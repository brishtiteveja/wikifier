A  <b>gamma camera</b> is a device used to  <b>image</b>  <b>gamma radiation</b> emitting  <b>radioisotopes</b>, a technique known as  <b>scintigraphy</b>. The applications of  <b>scintigraphy</b> include early  <b>drug development</b> and    <b>nuclear medical imaging</b>   to view and analyse images of the  <b>human body</b> of the distribution of medically injected, inhaled, or ingested    <b>radionuclides</b>   emitting    <b>gamma ray</b>  s.<br>A  <b>gamma camera</b> consists of one or more flat  <b>crystal</b>  <b>planes</b> or,  <b>detectors</b>, optically coupled to an  <b>array</b> of  <b>photomultiplier tubes</b>, the assembly is known as a  " head " , mounted on a gantry. The gantry is connected to a  <b>computer system</b> that both controls the operation of the  <b>camera</b> as well as  <b>acquisition</b> and  <b>storage</b> of acquired images.<br>The system accumulates events, or counts, of    <b>gamma</b>      <b>photon</b>  s that are absorbed by the  <b>crystal</b> in the  <b>camera</b>. Usually a large flat  <b>crystal</b> of  <b>sodium</b> iodide with  <b>thallium</b>  <b>doping</b> in a light-sealed housing is used. The  <b>highly efficient</b> capture method of this combination for detecting  <b>gamma rays</b> was discovered by noted physicist    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hofstadter" cat="person	scientist	physicist	alumnus">Robert Hofstadter</a>    in  <b>1948</b> ). <br>The crystal    <b>scintillate</b>  s in response to incident  <b>gamma radiation</b>. When a  <b>gamma photon</b> leaves the  <b>patient</b> (who has been injected with a   radioactive pharmaceutical  ), it knocks an  <b>electron</b> loose from an  <b>iodine atom</b> in the  <b>crystal</b>, and a  <b>faint</b>  <b>flash</b> of  <b>light</b> is produced when the  <b>dislocated</b>  <b>electron</b> again finds a minimal  <b>energy state</b>. The initial  <b>phenomenon</b> of the excited  <b>electron</b> is similar to the   photoelectric effect   and (particularly with  <b>gamma rays</b>) the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_scattering" cat="astrophysics">Compton effect</a>   . After the flash of  <b>light</b> is produced, it is detected.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photomultiplier" cat="devices	tube	sensor">Photomultiplier</a>    tubes ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photomultiplier" cat="devices	tube	sensor">PMTs</a> ) behind the  <b>crystal</b> detect the fluorescent flashes (events) and a computer sums the counts. The computer reconstructs and displays a  <b>two dimensional</b>  <b>image</b> of the relative  <b>spatial</b>  <b>count</b> density on a  <b>monitor</b>. This reconstructed  <b>image</b> reflects the distribution and relative  <b>concentration</b> of  <b>radioactive</b>  <b>tracer</b> elements present in the  <b>organs</b> and  <b>tissues</b> imaged.<br>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Anger" cat="biophysicist	person	engineer	physicist">Hal Anger</a>    developed the first  <b>gamma camera</b> in    <b>1957</b>  . His original  <b>design</b>, frequently called the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_camera" cat="sensor	invention">Anger camera</a> , is still widely used today. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_camera" cat="sensor	invention">Anger camera</a>  uses sets of   vacuum tube   photomultipliers. Generally each  <b>tube</b> has an exposed  <b>face</b> of about 3  <b>inches</b> in  <b>diameter</b> and the  <b>tubes</b> are arranged in  <b>hexagon</b> configurations, behind the absorbing  <b>crystal</b>. The  <b>electronic circuit</b> connecting the  <b>photodetectors</b> is wired so as to reflect the relative  <b>coincidence</b> of  <b>light</b>  <b>fluorescence</b> as sensed by the members of the  <b>hexagon</b>  <b>detector</b>  <b>array</b>. All the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photomultiplier" cat="devices	tube	sensor">PMTs</a>  simultaneously detect the (presumed) same  <b>flash</b> of  <b>light</b> to varying  <b>degrees</b>, depending on their position from the actual individual event. Thus the  <b>spatial location</b> of each  <b>single</b>  <b>flash</b> of  <b>fluorescence</b> is reflected as a  <b>pattern</b> of  <b>voltages</b> within the interconnecting circuit  <b>array</b>. <br>The location of the  <b>interaction</b> between the  <b>gamma ray</b> and the  <b>crystal</b> can be determined by processing the  <b>voltage</b> signals from the  <b>photomultipliers</b>; in simple terms, the location can be found by weighting the position of each  <b>photomultiplier tube</b> by the strength of its  <b>signal</b>, and then calculating a  <b>mean</b> position from the weighted positions. The total sum of the  <b>voltages</b> from each  <b>photomultiplier</b> is proportional to the  <b>energy</b> of the  <b>gamma ray</b>  <b>interaction</b>, thus allowing  <b>discrimination</b> between different  <b>isotopes</b> or between scattered and direct  <b>photons</b>.<br>In order to obtain  <b>spatial information</b> about the    <b>gamma</b>   emissions from an imaging subject (e.g. a person's  <b>heart</b>  <b>muscle</b>  <b>cells</b> which have absorbed an  <b>intravenous</b> injected  <b>radioactive</b>, usually thallium-201 or technetium-99m, medicinal imaging agent) a method of correlating the detected  <b>photons</b> with their point of origin is required.<br>The conventional method is to place a    <b>collimator</b>   over the detection crystal/PMT array.  The  <b>collimator</b> consists of a thick sheet of    <b>lead</b>  , typically  <b>1-3</b>  <b>inches</b> thick, with  <b>thousands</b> of adjacent holes through it.  The individual holes  <b>limit</b>  <b>photons</b> which can be detected by the  <b>crystal</b> to a  <b>cone</b>; the point of the  <b>cone</b> is at the  <b>midline</b>  <b>center</b> of any given hole and extends from the  <b>collimator</b>  <b>surface</b> outward.  However, the  <b>collimator</b> is also one of the sources of blurring within the  <b>image</b>;  <b>lead</b> does not totally  <b>attenuate</b> incident  <b>gamma</b>  <b>photons</b>, there can be some   crosstalk   between holes.<br>Unlike a  <b>lens</b>, as used in  <b>visible light</b>  <b>cameras</b>, the  <b>collimator</b> attenuates most ( 99%) of incident  <b>photons</b> and thus greatly limits the  <b>sensitivity</b> of the  <b>camera system</b>. Large amounts of  <b>radiation</b> must be present so as to provide enough  <b>exposure</b> for the  <b>camera system</b> to detect sufficient scintillation dots to form a picture.<br>Other methods of image localization (   <b>pinhole</b>  , rotating  <b>slat</b>  <b>collimator</b> with    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium_zinc_telluride" cat="material">CZT</a>    (Gagnon  "   <b>Matthews</b>) and others) have been proposed and tested; however, none have entered widespread routine  <b>clinical use</b>.<br>The best current  <b>camera system</b> designs can differentiate two separate  <b>point sources</b> of  <b>gamma</b>  <b>photons</b> located a minimum of 1.8 cm apart, at 5 cm away from the  <b>camera</b> face.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution" cat="optics">Spatial resolution</a>  decreases rapidly at increasing distances from the  <b>camera</b> face. This limits the  <b>spatial</b>  <b>accuracy</b> of the computer image: it is a fuzzy  <b>image</b> made up of many dots of detected but not precisely located  <b>scintillation</b>. This is a major limitation for  <b>heart muscle</b>  <b>imaging</b> systems; the thickest  <b>normal heart</b>  <b>muscle</b> in the  <b>left ventricle</b> is about 1.2 cm and most of the  <b>left ventricle</b>  <b>muscle</b> is about 0.8 cm, always moving and much of it beyond 5 cm from the  <b>collimator</b> face. To help compensate, better  <b>imaging</b> systems limit scintillation counting to a portion of the  <b>heart contraction</b> cycle, called gating, however this further limits system  <b>sensitivity</b>.<br>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography" cat="">SPECT</a>    (single photon emission computed tomograpy) imaging, as used in nuclear   cardiac stress test  ing, is performed using  <b>gamma</b>  <b>cameras</b>, usually one, two or three detectors or heads, are slowly rotated around the  <b>patient</b>'s  <b>torso</b>.<br>Multi-headed  <b>gamma</b>  <b>cameras</b> can also be used for    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography" cat="test">Positron emission tomography</a>    scanning, provided that their  <b>hardware</b> and  <b>software</b> can be configured to detect 'coincidences' (near simultaneous events on 2 different heads).  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_camera" cat="sensor	invention">Gamma camera</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography" cat="test">PET</a>  is markedly inferior to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography" cat="test">PET imaging</a>  with a purpose designed  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography" cat="test">PET scanner</a> , as the  <b>scintillator</b>  <b>crystal</b> has poor  <b>sensitivity</b> for the high-energy  <b>annihilation</b>  <b>photons</b>, and the  <b>detector</b>  <b>area</b> is significantly smaller. However, given the low cost of a  <b>gamma camera</b> and its additional flexibility compared to a dedicated  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography" cat="test">PET scanner</a> , this technique is useful where the expense and resource implications of a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography" cat="test">PET scanner</a>  cannot be justified.<br><br>
