 <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkification" cat="">Turkification</a>  is a term used to describe a process of  <b>cultural change</b> in which something or someone who is not a   Turk   becomes one, voluntarily or by  <b>force</b>.

They occurred trough     <b>religious conversion</b>  ,    <b>cultural</b>   and   language assimilation   during the time of    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seljuq_Empire" cat="state	dynasty	disestablishment	turk	country	monarchy	list	crusade">Seljuk Empire</a>   . The use of the term does not assert a denial of the existence of individuals who feel  <b>pride</b> or are comfortable in their  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_people" cat="group	turk	community	person	peoples	dispute">Turkishness</a> , nor a questioning of their  <b>identity</b>.<br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia" cat="">Anatolia</a>  was home to many different peoples in  <b>ancient times</b>, including the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carian_language" cat="language">Carian</a>   s,    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydian_language" cat="language">Lydian</a>   s,    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycian" cat="">Lycian</a>   s,    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia" cat="city	site	province	place">Cappadocian</a>   s,    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilicia" cat="state	region	province">Cilician</a>   s, and scores of others.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenization" cat="">Hellenization</a>    gradually caused many of these peoples to abandon their  <b>own languages</b> in favor of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" cat="language	variety">Greek</a> , especially in  <b>cities</b> and along the western and  <b>southern coasts</b>, a process reinforced by    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_(cultural)" cat="">Romanization</a>   . Nevertheless, in the north and east, especially in  <b>rural</b> areas, many of the  <b>native languages</b> continued to survive. Even by the  <b>eleventh century</b>, when  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" cat="empire	country	monarchy	state	disestablishment	dynasty">Turkish invaders</a>  first appeared,  "  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Greece" cat="">Greek culture</a>  was little more than a veneer so far as the mass of the people were concerned. "   Especially along the frontiers, the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" cat="">Byzantine</a>   s  <b>persecuted</b> local populations for    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy_in_Christianity" cat="dispute	terms	denomination">Christian heretical</a>    beliefs, causing these areas to have little  <b>sympathy</b> for Greek culture.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" cat="">Byzantine</a>    authorities routinely conducted large-scale  <b>population transfers</b> in an effort to  <b>impose</b>  <b>religious uniformity</b> and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language" cat="language	variety">Greek language</a> . They were particularly keen to  <b>assimilate</b> the large    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenians" cat="group	peoples	person">Armenian</a>    population. To that end, in the  <b>eleventh century</b>, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_nobility" cat="">Armenian nobility</a>  were removed from their lands and resettled throughout western  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia" cat="">Anatolia</a> . An  <b>unintended consequence</b> of this  <b>resettlement</b> was the loss of local  <b>military</b>  <b>leadership</b> along the eastern  <b>frontier</b>, opening the path for the inroads of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" cat="empire	country	monarchy	state	disestablishment	dynasty">Turkish invaders</a> . <br>Beginning in the  <b>eleventh century</b>, war with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" cat="empire	country	monarchy	state	disestablishment	dynasty">Turkish invaders</a>  led to the deaths of many in the native  <b>population</b>, while others were  <b>enslaved</b> and removed.  As areas became depopulated,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_peoples" cat="dispute">Turkic</a>   <b>nomads</b> moved in with their  <b>herds</b>. Once an  <b>area</b> had been conquered, and hostilities had  <b>ceased</b>,  <b>agricultural</b> villagers may have felt little inconvenience with the arrival of these  <b>pastoralists</b>, since they occupied different  <b>ecological zones</b> within the same territory.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_peoples" cat="dispute">Turkic</a>  pastoralists, however, made up only a small  <b>minority</b> of the  <b>population</b>, and the gradual  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkification" cat="">Turkification</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia" cat="">Anatolia</a>  was due to the  <b>conversion</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity" cat="">Christians</a>  to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam" cat="religion">Islam</a> , and their  <b>adoption</b> of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language" cat="language">Turkish language</a> . The reasons for this  <b>conversion</b> were first, the weak hold  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Greece" cat="">Greek culture</a>  had on much of the  <b>population</b>, and second, the desire by the conquered  <b>population</b> to  " retain its  <b>property</b> or else to avoid being at a disadvantage in other ways. "  One mark of the progress of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkification" cat="">Turkification</a>  was that by the  <b>1330s</b>,  <b>place names</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia" cat="">Anatolia</a>  had changed from Greek to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language" cat="language">Turkish</a> . <br>The    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" cat="empire	country	monarchy	state	disestablishment	dynasty">Ottomans</a>    had relative   tolerance   for different  <b>cultures</b> and  <b>religions</b>. The men of  <b>the ruling dynasty</b> took wives from various  <b>ethnic groups</b> and thus were of mixed  <b>ethnic</b> and  <b>cultural</b> heritage.<br>The word ''TÃ¼rk'' was a  <b>derogatory term</b> until the late  <b>19th century</b>, referring to backwards Anatolian  <b>nomads</b> or  <b>peasants</b>. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_classical_music" cat="">Ottoman elite</a>  identified themselves as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam" cat="">Sunni Muslims</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" cat="empire	country	monarchy	state	disestablishment	dynasty">Ottomans</a> , never as Turks. In the late  <b>19th century</b>, as European ideas of  <b>nationalism</b> were adopted by the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_classical_music" cat="">Ottoman elite</a> , and as it became clear that the Turkish-speakers of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia" cat="">Anatolia</a>  were the most loyal supporters of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" cat="empire	country	monarchy	state	disestablishment	dynasty">Ottoman rule</a> , the term ''TÃ¼rk'' took on a much more positive  <b>connotation</b>. <br>During  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" cat="empire	country	monarchy	state	disestablishment	dynasty">Ottoman times</a> , the    <b>millet</b>   system defined  <b>communities</b> on a  <b>religious</b> basis, and a residue of this remains in that Turkish villagers will commonly consider as Turks only those who profess the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam" cat="">Sunni</a>    faith, and will consider  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language" cat="language">Turkish-speaking</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Turkey" cat="group	jew	relations	dispute">Jews</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity" cat="">Christians</a> , or even    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alevi" cat="religion	muslim">Alevi</a>    Muslims to be  non-Turks. On the other hand, Kurdish-speaking or  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language" cat="language">Arabic-speaking</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam" cat="">Sunnis</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Anatolia_Region" cat="region">eastern Anatolia</a>  are often considered to be Turks. The imprecision of the appellation ''TÃ¼rk'' can also be seen with other  <b>ethnic</b> names, such as ''KÃ¼rt'', which is often applied by  <b>western</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia" cat="">Anatolians</a>  to anyone east of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adana" cat="site	place	city	colony">Adana</a> , even those who speak only  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language" cat="language">Turkish</a> . Thus, the category ''TÃ¼rk'', like other  <b>ethnic categories</b>  <b>popularly</b> used in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey" cat="country	nation	republic	state	member">Turkey</a> , does not have a  <b>uniform</b> usage.<br>In recent years,  <b>centrist</b> Turkish  <b>politicians</b> have attempted to redefine this category in a more  <b>multi-cultural</b> way, emphasizing that a ''TÃ¼rk'' is anyone who is a  <b>citizen</b> of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey" cat="country	nation	republic	state	member">Republic of Turkey</a> . Now article 66 of the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Turkey" cat="constitution">Turkish Constitution</a>    defines a  " ''Turk'' "  as anyone who is  " bound to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey" cat="country	nation	republic	state	member">Turkish state</a>  through the  <b>bond</b> of    <b>citizenship</b>   " .<br>The  <b>region</b> of the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia" cat="">Anatolia</a>    represents an extremely important  <b>area</b> with respect to ancient  <b>population</b>  <b>migration</b> and expansion, and the spread of the   Caucasian  ,    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages" cat="family	language">Indo-European</a>    and    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altaic_languages" cat="language">Altaic</a>  languages  , as well as the extiction of the local    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_languages" cat="language">Anatolian languages</a>   . During the late  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire" cat="state	disestablishment	empire	country">Roman Period</a> , prior to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_peoples" cat="dispute">Turkic</a>   <b>invasion</b>, the  <b>population</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia" cat="">Anatolia</a>  had  <b>reached</b> an estimated level of over 12 million people . The extent to which  <b>gene flow</b> from    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia" cat="region">Central Asia</a>    has contributed to the current  <b>gene pool</b> of the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_people" cat="group	turk	community	person	peoples	dispute">Turkish people</a>   , and the role of the  <b>11th century</b> invasion by    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_peoples" cat="dispute">Turkic peoples</a>   , has been the subject of several studies. These studies conclude that local   Anatolian   groups are the  <b>primary source</b> of the present-day  <b>Turkish population</b>.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" cat="">DNA</a>    results suggests the lack of strong  <b>genetic relationship</b> between the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongols" cat="peoples	group">Mongols</a>    and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_peoples" cat="dispute">Turks</a>  despite the historical relationship of their  <b>languages</b>.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia" cat="">Anatolians</a>    do not significantly differ from other    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea" cat="ecoregions">Mediterranean</a>    populations, indicating that while the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian" cat="">Asian</a>    Turks carried out an  <b>invasion</b> with   cultural   significance (language and religion), the genetic significance is only weakly detectable. Recent   genetic   research has  <b>suggested</b> the local    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia" cat="">Anatolia</a>   n origins of the Turks and that  <b>genetic flow</b> between Turks and   Asiatic   peoples might have been slight. These findings are consistent with a   model   in which the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_languages" cat="language	peoples">Turkic languages</a>   , originating in the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altay" cat="">Altai</a>   -   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayan" cat="">Sayan</a>    region of    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia" cat="region">Central Asia</a>    and northwestern    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolia" cat="republic	country	state">Mongolia</a>   , were imposed on the    <b>indigenous peoples</b>   with relatively little    <b>genetic</b>   admixture, possible example of    <b>elite</b>     cultural     dominance   -    <b>driven linguistic replacement</b>  . These observations also may be explained by    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia" cat="">Anatolia</a>    having the lowest    <b>migrant</b>  /  resident   ratio at the time of    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_migration" cat="peoples">Turkic migrations</a>   . Analysis suggested that, genetically,   Anatolian  s are more closely related also with the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans" cat="region">Balkan</a>   ian populations than to the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia" cat="region">Central Asian</a>    populations.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy" cat="loanword	semantics	argument	linguistics	model">Analogical</a>  results have been received in neighbouring    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus" cat="">Caucasus</a>    region by testing    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_language" cat="language">Armenian</a>    and    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_Turkic_origin" cat="list">Turkic</a>    speaking    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijani_people" cat="group	peoples	community	turk">Azerbaijanian</a>    populations, therefore representing ''language replacements'', possibly via ''elite dominance'' involving primarily  <b>male</b>  <b>migrants</b>. As concusion, today the major    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" cat="">DNA</a>    components in Anatolian  <b>population</b> are shared with    <b>European</b>   and neighboring   Near Eastern   populations and contrast with only a minor share of   haplogroup  s related to    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia" cat="region">Central Asian</a>   , Indian and African affinity, wich supports the ''language replacement hypothesis'' in the region.<br><br>
