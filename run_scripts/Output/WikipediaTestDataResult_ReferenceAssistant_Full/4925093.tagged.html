 <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_length" cat="phenomenon">Day length</a> , or length of day, or length of daytime, refers to the  <b>temporal</b> length of a day, or  <b>24</b> hours, during which there is  <b>daylight</b>.<br>Due to the    <b>diffusion</b>   and    <b>refraction</b>   of    <b>sunlight</b>   by the   atmosphere  , there is actually    <b>daylight</b>   even when the   sun   is slightly below the    <b>horizon</b>  . <br>Theoretically, the  <b>day length</b> can be computed from the moment the  <b>upper limb</b> of the   sun  's  <b>disk</b> appears on the    <b>horizon</b>   during    <b>sunrise</b>   to the moment when the  <b>upper limb</b> disappears at the    <b>horizon</b>   during    <b>sunset</b>  . <br>More  <b>conveniently</b>, however, the center of the  <b>sun</b> is often used in place of the  <b>upper limb</b> for computing the  <b>day length</b>. When    <b>sunrise</b>   and    <b>sunset</b>   do occur, the  <b>day length</b> can be computed as 2ω sub o /sub /15 , where ω sub o /sub  is the    <b>sunset</b>      <b>hour angle</b>   in  <b>degrees</b> ( ) given by the    sunset equation  . When    <b>sunrise</b>   and    <b>sunset</b>   do not occur during the course of a day, the  <b>day length</b> is either 0 or  <b>24</b> hours. <br>To considerable  <b>accuracy</b>, all the points at the same  <b>latitude</b> on the same  <b>calendar date</b> can be considered to have the same  <b>day length</b>. The   contour   plot in the figure is computed using the   sunset equation  .<br><br>
