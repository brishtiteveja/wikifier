The  <b>Politics</b> of  <b>the United Kingdom</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" cat="country	member	nation	state	template">Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a>  takes place in the  <b>framework</b> of a    <b>constitutional monarchy</b>  , in which the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy" cat="title	system	loanword	position	type	form">Monarch</a>    is    <b>head of state</b>   and the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="office">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>    is the    <b>head of government</b>  .    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)" cat="institution">Executive power</a>    is exercised by the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" cat="country	member	nation	state	template">UK</a>  government   and the    <b>devolved</b>   governments of    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" cat="country	nation">Scotland</a>    and    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales" cat="region	country	nation">Wales</a>    and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raincoats_(Seinfeld)" cat="episode">the Executive</a>  of    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland" cat="region	country	dispute	state">Northern Ireland</a>   .    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature" cat="legislature">Legislative power</a>    is vested in both the  <b>government</b> and the  <b>two chambers</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="legislature	parliament	dispute	establishment">Parliament</a> , the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="house">House of Commons</a>    and the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords" cat="house">House of Lords</a>   , as well as in the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament" cat="parliament	legislature	establishment">Scottish parliament</a>    and Welsh and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland" cat="region	country	dispute	state">Northern Irish</a>   <b>assemblies</b>. The    <b>judiciary</b>   is independent of the  <b>executive</b> and the  <b>legislature</b>, though several    <b>senior judges</b>   are still members of the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords" cat="house">House of Lords</a>   , which is currently the  <b>highest court</b> of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" cat="country	member	nation	state	template">UK</a>  for  <b>civil cases</b> and the  <b>highest court</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales" cat="">England and Wales</a>  for  <b>criminal cases</b>.

Though  <b>coalition</b> and  <b>minority governments</b> have been an  <b>occasional</b> feature of    <b>Parliamentary</b>   politics, the    <b>first-past-the-post</b>   electoral system used for    <b>general elections</b>   tends to maintain the dominance of these two  <b>parties</b>, though each has in the past century relied upon a  <b>third party</b> to deliver a working majority in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="legislature	parliament	dispute	establishment">Parliament</a> . <br>The    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats" cat="democrat	party">Liberal Democrats</a>   , a party formed by the  <b>merger</b> of the former    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)" cat="party">Liberal Party</a>    and    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_(UK)" cat="party	group">Social Democratic Party</a>    in  <b>1988</b>, is the third largest party in  <b>the British parliament</b>. It seeks a  <b>reform</b> of the  <b>electoral system</b> to address the  <b>disproportionate</b> dominance of the two main  <b>parties</b> that results from the current system. <br>Growing support for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_nationalism" cat="politics	movement">'Nationalist'</a>   <b>parties</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" cat="country	nation">Scotland</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales" cat="region	country	nation">Wales</a>  led to proposals for    <b>devolution</b>   in the  <b>1970s</b> though only in the  <b>1990s</b> did  <b>devolution</b> actually happen.  Today,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" cat="country	nation">Scotland</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales" cat="region	country	nation">Wales</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland" cat="region	country	dispute	state">Northern Ireland</a>  each possess a  <b>legislature</b> and  <b>government</b> alongside that of  <b>the United Kingdom</b>, responsible for  <b>devolved matters</b>. However, this increased   autonomy   and    <b>devolution</b>   of  <b>executive</b> and  <b>legislative powers</b> has not contributed to a reduction in support for  <b>full independence</b>. Indeed, the principal  <b>pro-independence party</b>, the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party" cat="party	politics	organization">Scottish National Party</a>   , won 20 extra  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament" cat="member">MSPs</a>  at the  <b>2007</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_general_election,_2007" cat="election">Scottish parliament elections</a>  and now forms the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government" cat="organisation	establishment">Scottish Government</a>   , with plans to hold a  <b>referendum</b> on negotiating for  <b>independence</b>, before  <b>2011</b>.

However,  <b>sovereignty</b> in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" cat="country	member	nation	state	template">UK</a>  no longer rests with the  <b>monarch</b>, since the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689" cat="laws">English Bill of Rights in 1689</a>   , which established the principle of    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty" cat="dispute	politics	terms">Parliamentary sovereignty</a>   . Nonetheless, the  <b>monarch</b> is still known as the  <b>sovereign</b>.<br>The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="">British sovereign</a>  possesses many powers, including the right to choose any  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality_law" cat="">British citizen</a>  to be her   Prime  <b>Minister</b>   and the right to call and  <b>dissolve</b>    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="legislature	parliament	dispute	establishment">Parliament</a>    whenever she wishes. However, in  <b>accordance</b> with the current  <b>uncodified constitution</b>, the Prime  <b>Minister</b> is the leader of the largest party in the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="house">House of Commons</a>   , and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="legislature	parliament	dispute	establishment">Parliament</a>  is    <b>dissolved</b>   at the time suggested by the  <b>PM</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II" cat="person	woman	presbyterian	leaders	recipient	philanthropist	anglican	dame	princess	officer">The monarch</a>  retains the ability to deny giving a   bill      <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Assent" cat="">Royal Assent</a>   , although in modern times this becomes  <b>increasingly</b> more unlikely, as it would cause a    <b>constitutional crisis</b>  .    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Great_Britain" cat="">Queen Anne</a>    was the last  <b>monarch</b> to  <b>exercise</b> this  <b>power</b>, which she did on    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_11" cat="days">11 March</a>       <b>1708</b>   with regard to a bill  " for the settling of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia" cat="organization	group	politics">Militia</a>  in    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" cat="country	nation">Scotland</a>    " . Other royal powers called    <b>royal prerogative</b>  , such as  <b>patronage</b> to appoint ministers and the ability to declare  <b>war</b>, are exercised by the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister" cat="title	minister">Prime Minister</a>  and the   Cabinet  , with the formal  <b>consent</b> of  <b>the Queen</b>. <br>Today the  <b>sovereign</b> has an essentially   ceremonial   role restricted in  <b>exercise</b> of  <b>power</b> by   convention   and    <b>public opinion</b>  . However the  <b>monarch</b> does continue to  <b>exercise</b> three essential rights: the ''right to be consulted, the right to advise and the right to warn''. As a consequence of these ideals, Prime  <b>Ministers</b> hold weekly  <b>confidential</b> meetings with the  <b>monarch</b> in which the sovereign holds the right to express her opinions. <br>In formal terms, the ''Crown in Parliament'' is sovereign even though in practical terms the  <b>political</b> head of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" cat="country	member	nation	state	template">UK</a>  is the   Prime Minister   (   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Brown" cat="person	member	politician	rector	presbyterian	academic	leaders	journalist	chancellor	scholar	right">Gordon Brown</a>    since    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_27" cat="days">27 June</a>       <b>2007</b>  ). However, the real powers of position of the  <b>monarch</b> in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="dispute	politics">British Constitution</a>  should not be downplayed.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II" cat="person	woman	presbyterian	leaders	recipient	philanthropist	anglican	dame	princess	officer">The monarch</a>  does indeed retain some  <b>power</b>, but it has to be used with discretion. She fulfills the necessary  <b>constitutional role</b> as head of  <b>state</b>, and with the absence of a distinct separation of powers as in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">American</a>   <b>model</b> and a strong  <b>second chamber</b>, acts as a final  <b>check</b> on  <b>executive power</b>. If a time came to pass, for instance, when a  <b>law</b> threatened the freedom or  <b>security</b> of her    <b>subjects and citizens</b>  ,  <b>the Queen</b> could decline  <b>royal assent</b>, free as she is from the  <b>eddies</b> of  <b>party politics</b>. Furthermore, armed removal of her by Parliament or  <b>Government</b> would be difficult, as the  <b>monarch</b> remains    <b>commander-in-chief</b>   of the  <b>armed forces</b>, who swear an    <b>oath of allegiance</b>   to her.<br>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)" cat="institution">Executive power</a>    in  <b>the United Kingdom</b> is exercised on behalf of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy" cat="title	system	loanword	position	type	form">Sovereign</a> , in whom  <b>executive power</b> is theoretically and nominally vested, by the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="branch">UK government</a>    and the    <b>devolved</b>      <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government" cat="organisation	establishment">Scottish Government</a>   ,    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Government" cat="politics	organisation">Welsh Assembly Government</a>    and the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Executive" cat="establishment	organisation">Northern Ireland Executive</a>   .<br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II" cat="person	woman	presbyterian	leaders	recipient	philanthropist	anglican	dame	princess	officer">The monarch</a>  appoints a    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister" cat="title	minister">Prime Minister</a>    as the head of    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="branch">Her Majesty's Government</a>   , guided by the strict  <b>convention</b> that the Prime Minister should be the member of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="house">House of Commons</a>  most likely to be able to form a  <b>Government</b> with the support of that  <b>House</b>.  In practice, this means that the leader of the    <b>political party</b>   with an  <b>absolute majority</b> of seats in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="house">House of Commons</a>  is chosen to be the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister" cat="title	minister">Prime Minister</a> . The Prime  <b>Minister</b> then selects the other    <b>Ministers</b>   which make up the Government and act as  <b>political</b> heads of the various    <b>Government Departments</b>  . About twenty of the most  <b>senior government ministers</b> make up the   Cabinet   and approximately 100  <b>ministers</b> in total comprise the  <b>government</b>.  In  <b>accordance</b> with    <b>constitutional convention</b>  , all  <b>ministers</b> within the  <b>government</b> are either   Members of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="legislature	parliament	dispute	establishment">Parliament</a>    or   peers   in the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords" cat="house">House of Lords</a>   .  <br>As in some other    <b>parliamentary system</b>  s of  <b>government</b> (especially those based upon the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_system" cat="system">Westminster System</a>   ), the  <b>executive</b> (called  " the  <b>government</b> " ) is drawn from and is answerable to Parliament - a successful   vote of  <b>no confidence</b>   will  <b>force</b> the  <b>government</b> either to resign or to seek a    <b>parliamentary dissolution</b>   and a   general election  . In practice, members of  <b>parliament</b> of all major  <b>parties</b> are strictly controlled by    <b>whips</b>   who try to ensure they vote according to party policy. If the  <b>government</b> has a large majority, then they are very unlikely to lose enough votes to be unable to pass  <b>legislation</b>. <br>In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2005" cat="days">November 2005</a> , the  <b>Blair government</b> suffered its first defeat, on a   proposal   to extend the period for detaining  <b>terrorist suspects</b> to  <b>90 days</b>. Before this, the last bill proposed by a  <b>government</b> that was defeated in the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="house">House of Commons</a>    was the   Shop Hours Bill   in  <b>1986</b>, one of only three in the  <b>20th century</b>. Governments with a small   majority  , or    <b>coalition government</b>  s are much more vulnerable to defeat. They sometimes have to  <b>resort</b> to  <b>extreme measures</b>, such as  " wheeling in "  sick MPs, to get the necessary majority.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" cat="convert	chemist	person	leaders	survivor	methodists	lawyer	secretary	peer	member	critic	head	woman	chancellor	anglican	dispute">Margaret Thatcher</a>    in 1983 and    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair" cat="member	person	convert	leaders	effort	recipient	witness">Tony Blair</a>    in  <b>1997</b> were swept into power with such large majorities that even allowing for  <b>dissent</b> within their  <b>parties</b>, they were assured of winning practically all  <b>parliamentary</b> votes, and thus were able to implement  <b>radical</b> programmes of  <b>legislative</b> reform and  <b>innovation</b>. But other Prime  <b>Ministers</b> who enjoy only slender majorities, such as    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Major" cat="chancellor	member	leaders	councillor	person	historian	president	secretary	anglican	survivor	scandal">John Major</a>    in  <b>1992</b>, can easily lose votes if relatively small numbers of their    <b>backbench</b>   MPs defy the whip and vote against the Government's proposals. Therefore, Governments with small majorities find it more difficult to implement  <b>controversial legislation</b> and can become bogged down cutting  <b>deals</b> with factions within their party or seeking assistance from other  <b>political parties</b>.<br>The Government of  <b>the United Kingdom</b> contains a number of    <b>ministries</b>   known mainly, though not exclusively as  <b>departments</b>,  <b>e.g</b>.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)" cat="ministry	department	unit">Ministry of Defence</a>   . These are politically led by a    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government)" cat="">Government Minister</a>    who is often a    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State" cat="">Secretary of State</a>    and member of the   Cabinet  . He or she may also be supported by a number of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government)" cat="">junior Ministers</a> .  In practice, several  <b>government</b>  <b>departments</b> and  <b>Ministers</b> have responsibilities that cover  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" cat="manufacturer">England</a>  alone, where  <b>devolved</b> bodies having responsibility for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" cat="country	nation">Scotland</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales" cat="region	country	nation">Wales</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland" cat="region	country	dispute	state">Northern Ireland</a> , (for example - the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_(United_Kingdom)" cat="department	ministry">Department of Health</a>   ), or responsibilities that mainly focus on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" cat="manufacturer">England</a>  (such as the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Children,_Schools_and_Families" cat="agency	department	institution">Department for Children, Schools and Families</a>   ).<br><br>
