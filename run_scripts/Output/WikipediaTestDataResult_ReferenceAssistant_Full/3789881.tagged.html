Forces loyal to the   Emperor   and led by    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitta_Yoshisada" cat="personnel	person">Nitta Yoshisada</a>    entered the  <b>city</b> from multiple directions and destroyed it; in the end, the Hōjō leaders retreated to the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tōshō-ji" cat="">Tōshō-ji</a>   , where they committed  <b>suicide</b>.<br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_hills_of_Rome" cat="list">The hills</a>  surrounding the  <b>shogunal</b>  <b>capital</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamakura,_Kanagawa" cat="city	place">Kamakura</a>  contained seven passes, each with guarded checkpoints.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitta_Yoshisada" cat="personnel	person">Nitta Yoshisada</a>  attacked from the north, east, and west, dividing his  <b>force</b> in three.
