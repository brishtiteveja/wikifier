A  <b>senate</b> is a   deliberative body  , often the    <b>upper house</b>   or chamber of a    <b>legislature</b>  . There have been many such bodies in  <b>history</b>, the first of which was the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate" cat="legislature">Roman Senate</a>   .<br>The word ''senatorial'' is derived from the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" cat="language">Latin</a>    word ''senƒÅtus'' (senate), which comes from ''senex'',  " old man " . The members or  <b>legislators</b> of a  <b>senate</b> are called senators.  The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" cat="language">Latin</a>  word ''senator'' was adopted into  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" cat="language">English</a>  with no change in  <b>spelling</b>.  Its meaning is derived from a very ancient form of simple  <b>social organization</b> in which  <b>decision-making</b> powers are reserved for the eldest men.  For the same reason, the word ''senate'' is correctly used when referring to any powerful  <b>authority</b> characteristically composed by the eldest members of a  <b>community</b>, as a  <b>deliberative body</b> of a  <b>faculty</b> in an  <b>institution</b> of  <b>higher learning</b> is often called a  <b>senate</b>.  The original  <b>senate</b> was the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate" cat="legislature">Roman Senate</a>   , which lasted until    <b>580</b>  . In the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" cat="">Eastern Roman Empire</a>   , the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Senate" cat="legislature	establishment">Byzantine Senate</a>    continued until the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Crusade" cat="state">Fourth Crusade</a>   .<br>Modern  <b>democratic</b>  <b>states</b> with   bicameral      <b>parliamentary system</b>  s are sometimes equipped with a  <b>senate</b>, often distinguished from an ordinary parallel    <b>lower house</b>  , known variously as the  "    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives" cat="legislature">House of Representatives</a>    " ,  "    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons" cat="legislature">House of Commons</a>    " ,  "    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_Deputies" cat="house">Chamber of Deputies</a>    " ,  "    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly" cat="legislature">National Assembly</a>    " ,  "    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Assembly" cat="legislature">Legislative Assembly</a>    " , or  "    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Assembly" cat="legislature">House of Assembly</a>    " , by electoral rules.  This may include minimum age required for voters and candidates, proportional or   majoritarian   or    <b>plurality</b>   system, and an electoral basis or ''collegium''.  Typically, the  <b>senate</b> is referred to as the  <b>upper house</b> and has a smaller membership than the  <b>lower house</b>.  In some   federal state  s  <b>senates</b> also exist at the  <b>subnational</b> level. In the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">United States</a>    all  <b>states</b> other than    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska" cat="state">Nebraska</a>    have a  <b>state</b>  <b>senate</b>. In   Australia   all states other than    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland" cat="state	colony">Queensland</a>    have an  <b>upper house</b> known as a   legislative council  . Several  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada" cat="province	subdivision	list">Canadian provinces</a>  also once had  <b>legislative councils</b>, but these have all been abolished, the last being    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec" cat="state	province">Quebec</a>   's    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_council" cat="legislature">Legislative Council</a>    in    <b>1968</b>  . <br>Senate membership can be determined either through elections or appointments.  For example,  <b>elections</b> are held every three years for half the membership of the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate" cat="establishment	house	politics">Australian Senate</a>   , the term of a  <b>senator</b> being six years.  In contrast, members of the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Canada" cat="">Canadian Senate</a>    are appointed by the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_General_of_Canada" cat="">Governor General</a>    upon the recommendation of the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada" cat="">Prime Minister of Canada</a>   , holding the office until they resign, are removed, or retire at the mandatory age of 75.  Some states have a combination of these two approaches, such as the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Jamaica" cat="politics	parliament">Jamaican Senate</a>   , where thirteen are appointed by the  <b>prime</b>  <b>minister</b> and eight by the    <b>leader of the opposition</b>  . In larger countries, the  <b>senate</b> often serves a balancing effect by giving a larger share of  <b>power</b> to  <b>regions</b> or groups which would otherwise be overwhelmed under strictly popular    <b>apportionment</b>  . <br>The terms Senate and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate" cat="legislature	house">Senator</a> , however, do not necessarily refer to a  <b>second chamber</b> of a legislature:<br><br>
