Such  <b>iconoclastic</b> shows as ''   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_&_Martin's_Laugh-In" cat="family">Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In</a>   '', ''   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python's_Flying_Circus" cat="show	ending">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a>   '', ''   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Vivino" cat="person	actor">The Uncle Floyd Show</a>   '', ''  Saturday Night Live  '' and even ''   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Kangaroo" cat="show	captain	winner	program	child	ending">Captain Kangaroo</a>   '' and ''   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street" cat="ending	program	adaptation">Sesame Street</a>   '', and  <b>TV</b> hosts like    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Letterman" cat="person	host	winner	presenter	alumnus	owner">David Letterman</a>     are seen as having made use of Kovacs' influence. <br>Born to parents of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_people" cat="group	peoples	nomad	person">Hungarian descent</a> ,  <b>Kovacs</b> was influenced deeply by his    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenton_Central_High_School" cat="school	institution">Trenton Central High School</a>    drama teacher, Harold Van Kirk, and thus went to acting  <b>school</b> after his  <b>1937</b>  <b>graduation</b>. His first paid  <b>entertainment</b> work was as a  <b>disc jockey</b> on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenton_Central_High_School" cat="school	institution">Trenton</a> 's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTTM" cat="stations">WTTM</a>   <b>radio</b>, which led eventually to his first  <b>television</b> job in  <b>1949</b>, a show called ''   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_to_Get_Ready" cat="">Three to Get Ready</a>   '', at    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" cat="network	company">NBC</a>   's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia" cat="county	city	settlement	capital	loanword	seats	place">Philadelphia</a>   <b>affiliate</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPTZ" cat="channels	stations	affiliate">WPTZ</a> .  ''Three to Get Ready'' was  <b>groundbreaking</b>, as the first regularly scheduled  <b>early morning</b> (7-9 am) show in a major  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_market" cat="market">TV market</a> . Prior to this, it had been assumed that no one would  <b>watch</b>  <b>TV</b> at such an early  <b>hour</b>. The success of ''Three to Get Ready'' proved the  <b>theory</b> wrong and was one of the factors that led  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" cat="network	company">NBC</a>  to create ''  The Today Show  '', which led to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPTZ" cat="channels	stations	affiliate">WPTZ</a> 's cancellation of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Kovacs" cat="person	actor	host	winner	comedian	burial	personality">Ernie</a> 's local show in favor of the  <b>network</b> offering.<br>At  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPTZ" cat="channels	stations	affiliate">WPTZ</a> ,  <b>Kovacs</b> first began to use the  <b>ad-libbed</b> and  <b>experimental</b> style that would come to make his reputation, including  <b>video effects</b>, superimpositions, reverse  <b>polarities</b> and scanning, and quick blackouts. He was also noted for abstraction and carefully-timed   non-sequitur   gags, and for carefully allowing the so-called  "    <b>fourth wall</b>   "  to be breached.  Kovacs' cameras commonly showed his viewers activity beyond the boundaries of the show   set  ---including crew members and, on occasion, outside the    <b>studio</b>   itself.  <b>Kovacs</b> also  <b>liked</b> talking to the off-camera  <b>crew</b> and even introduced segments from the  <b>studio control room</b>.   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Kovacs" cat="person	actor	host	winner	comedian	burial	personality">Ernie</a>  frequently made use of accidents and  <b>happenstance</b>, incorporating the unexpected into his shows. One of Kovacs'  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia" cat="county	city	settlement	capital	loanword	seats	place">Philadelphia</a>  broadcasts was  " enlivened "  by a  <b>homeless</b> man who sought shelter inside the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_studio" cat="studio">TV studio</a> ;  <b>Kovacs</b> invited him onto the set, where he slept for the duration of the telecast, but nonetheless was introduced on  <b>camera</b> to the  <b>audience</b> as  " Sleeping Schwartz. " <br>Kovacs' love of  <b>spontaneity</b> extended to his crew, who would  <b>occasionally</b> play live, on-air pranks on him, just to see how he would react.  During one of his  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" cat="network	company">NBC</a>  shows,  <b>Kovacs</b> was appearing as his inept  <b>magician</b>  <b>character</b> Matzoh Heppelwhite.  The sketch called for the  <b>magician</b> to  <b>frequently</b> hit a  <b>gong</b>, which was the signal for a  <b>sexy</b>  <b>female assistant</b> to bring out a  <b>bottle</b> and  <b>shot glass</b> for a quick snort of  <b>alcohol</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagehand" cat="profession">Stagehands</a>  substituted real  <b>liquor</b> for the  <b>iced tea</b> normally used for the gag. The look on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Kovacs" cat="person	actor	host	winner	comedian	burial	personality">Ernie</a> 's  <b>face</b> upon taking the first shot was priceless, as he realized (correctly) that he would likely be called upon to  <b>drink</b> a shot of  <b>liquor</b> for each successive  <b>gong</b>.  But  <b>Kovacs</b> pressed on with the sketch, and was quite  <b>inebriated</b> by the end of the show.  On another occasion, while doing his  "  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Dovetonsils" cat="character	sketch	poet">Percy Dovetonsils</a>  "  character, he found that his  <b>drink</b> contained a live  <b>fish</b>.<br> <b>Kovacs</b>  <b>helped</b> develop    <b>camera</b>   tricks still common almost fifty years after his  <b>death</b>, one of which became one of his signature gags.  His character  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene" cat="">Eugene</a>  sat at a table to eat his  <b>lunch</b>, but as he removed items one at a time from a  <b>lunch box</b>, he watched them inexplicably roll down the table into the lap of a man reading a  <b>newspaper</b> at the other end.  When  <b>Kovacs</b> poured  <b>milk</b> from a  <b>thermos bottle</b>, the  <b>stream</b> flowed in a seemingly unusual direction. Never seen on  <b>television</b> before  <b>Kovacs</b> tried it, the gag's secret was using a tilted table in front of a  <b>camera</b> tilted to the same  <b>angle</b>. <br> <b>Kovacs</b> constantly sought new techniques and used both primitive and improvised ways of creating  <b>visual effects</b> that would be done electronically after his time. One innovative  <b>construction</b> involved attaching a    <b>kaleidoscope</b>   to a  <b>camera lens</b> with  <b>cardboard</b> and  <b>tape</b>, and setting the resulting  <b>abstract</b> images to  <b>music</b>. An  <b>underwater</b>  <b>stunt</b> involved  <b>Kovacs</b> an inveterate  <b>cigar</b> smoker sitting in an easy  <b>chair</b>, reading his  <b>newspaper</b>, and somehow smoking his  <b>cigar</b>.  Removing it from his  <b>mouth</b>,  <b>Kovacs</b> was able to  <b>exhale</b> a  <b>puff</b> of  <b>white smoke</b>, all while floating underwater. The trick: the  " smoke "  was a small amount of  <b>milk</b> with which he filled his  <b>mouth</b> before submerging.<br>He also developed such routines as an  <b>all-gorilla</b> version of ''   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Lake" cat="ballet	composition">Swan Lake</a>   ''; a  <b>poker</b>  <b>game</b> set to    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven" cat="view">Beethoven</a>   's ''   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._5_(Beethoven)" cat="symphony	composition">Fifth Symphony</a>   ''; the '' <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Show" cat="special">Silent Show</a> '', in which a  <b>nerdy</b> character interacts with the world accompanied solely by  <b>music</b> and  <b>sound effects</b>;  <b>parodies</b> of typical  <b>television commercials</b> and  <b>movie</b>  <b>genres</b>; and various musical segments with everyday items (such as  <b>kitchen</b>  <b>appliances</b> or  <b>office equipment</b>) moving in  <b>sync</b> to  <b>music</b>.  A popular  <b>recurring sketch</b> was    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nairobi_Trio" cat="sketch	character">The Nairobi Trio</a>   , three derby-hatted  <b>apes</b> miming mechanically and rhythmically to the tune  " Solfeggio. " <br> <b>Kovacs</b> could use extended  <b>sketches</b> and mood pieces or quick  <b>blackout</b> gags lasting only seconds. Some of these could be expensive, such as his famous  <b>used car salesman</b> routine with a jalopy and a breakaway floor---it cost a reported $50,000 to produce the six-second gag. He was also one of the first  <b>television</b>  <b>comedians</b> to use odd fake credits and comments between the  <b>legitimate</b> credits and, at times, during his routines.<br> <b>Kovacs</b> reportedly disliked working in front of a live  <b>audience</b>, as was the case with the shows he did for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" cat="network	company">NBC</a>  in the  <b>1950s</b>. He found the presence of an  <b>audience</b> distracting.  And those in the seats frequently did not understand some of the more elaborate visual gags and  <b>special effects</b>, which could only be appreciated by watching  <b>studio monitors</b> instead of the  <b>stage</b>.<br>Like many comedians of the era,  <b>Kovacs</b> created a rotation of recurring roles.  In addition to the silent  "  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene" cat="">Eugene</a> , "  his most familiar characters were the fey, lisping poet    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Dovetonsils" cat="character	sketch	poet">Percy Dovetonsils</a>   ; the heavily-accented German   disc jockey   Wolfgang von Sauerbraten; and Mr. Question Man, who would answer  <b>queries</b> supposedly sent in by viewers.  Others included  <b>horror</b> show host Auntie Gruesome; bumbling  <b>magician</b> Matzoh Heppelwhite;  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miklos_Molnar" cat="footballer	person	player">Miklos Molnar</a> , the  <b>sardonic</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language" cat="language">Hungarian</a>  host of a  <b>cooking show</b>; and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" cat="nation	country	state	republic	member">Frenchman</a>  Pierre Ragout.<br> <b>Kovacs</b>'s  <b>television programs</b> included ''   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_to_Get_Ready" cat="">Three to Get Ready</a>   ''; ''  Time for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Kovacs" cat="person	actor	host	winner	comedian	burial	personality">Ernie</a>   '' (1951);  ''   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Kovacs" cat="person	actor	host	winner	comedian	burial	personality">Ernie</a>  in Kovacsland  '' (also 1951); ''   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ernie_Kovacs_Show" cat="show">The Ernie Kovacs Show</a>   '' ( <b>1952-1953</b>; 1955-1956); a twice-a-week job filling in for    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Allen" cat="host	musician	writer	person	winner	humanist	comedian	skeptic	artist	alumnus">Steve Allen</a>    as host of ''   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tonight_Show" cat="show">The Tonight Show</a>   '' on Mondays and Tuesdays (1956-57); and, a  <b>game show</b>, ''  Take a Good Look  '' (1959-   <b>1961</b>  ).  <b>Kovacs</b> later publicly accused  <b>Allen</b> of stealing material and characters from him, then performing them in only slightly obfuscated form. (For example, Kovacs'  " Mr. Question Man "  bore a resemblance to  <b>Allen</b>'s  " Answer Man " , and later,    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Carson" cat="host	personnel	entertainer	person	winner	skeptic	officer	comedian">Johnny Carson</a>   's long-running  "  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnac" cat="place	site">Carnac</a>  "  character.)   <b>Kovacs</b> also had a  <b>short</b> stint as a  <b>celebrity</b>  <b>panelist</b> on ''   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What's_My_Line?" cat="show	program	game	ending">What's My Line?</a>   '', but took his responsibilities less than seriously, often eschewing a  <b>legitimate</b> question for the  <b>sake</b> of a  <b>laugh</b>. An example would be when industrialist    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_J._Kaiser" cat="shipbuilder	person	philanthropist">Henry J. Kaiser</a>    was the program's  " Mystery Guest. "  Previous questioning had established that the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_guest" cat="">Mystery Guest</a> 's  <b>last name</b> was synonymous with a make of automobile ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_J._Kaiser" cat="shipbuilder	person	philanthropist">Kaiser</a>  had founded the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_J._Kaiser" cat="shipbuilder	person	philanthropist">Kaiser</a>   <b>automobile</b>  <b>company</b> in 1945), prompting  <b>Kovacs</b> to ask,  " This may seem like a  <b>long shot</b>, sir, but by any chance are you    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" cat="republican	person	skeptic	lawyer	member	candidate	president	leaders	postmaster	nominee">Abraham Lincoln</a>   ?

A series of monthly  <b>half-hour</b> specials for    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" cat="subsidiary">ABC</a>    in 1961-62 are often considered his best  <b>television</b> work.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Wonka" cat="inventor	character	chef	scientist	person">The latter</a>  shot on  <b>videotape</b>, using new editing and  <b>special effects</b> techniques  won a 1961    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award" cat="award">Emmy Award</a>   .     <b>Kovacs</b>   and his co-director   Joe Behar   also won the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directors_Guild_of_America" cat="union	relations">Directors Guild of America</a>    award for an ''   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Kovacs" cat="person	actor	host	winner	comedian	burial	personality">Ernie Kovacs</a>  Special  '' based on the earlier silent  "    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene" cat="">Eugene</a>    "  program.  Kovacs' last  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" cat="subsidiary">ABC</a>  special was aired posthumously.<br>But what made  <b>Kovacs</b> unique may also have been what made him a  <b>hard sell</b> to  <b>television</b> viewers used to  <b>situation comedies</b> and  <b>variety shows</b>. Having a  <b>cult</b> following at best,  <b>Kovacs</b> rarely had a highly-rated show. His friend    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Lemmon" cat="personnel	winner	burial	artist	person	actor	director	alumnus	officer">Jack Lemmon</a>    was once quoted as saying no one ever understood  <b>Kovacs</b>'s work because  " he was always 15 years ahead of everyone else. " <br> " The existence of these separate shows is testament to both the  <b>success and failure</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Kovacs" cat="person	actor	host	winner	comedian	burial	personality">Ernie Kovacs</a> , "  says  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Museum_(album)" cat="album">the Museum</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting" cat="">Broadcast Communications</a> .  " A brilliant and innovative entertainer, he was a failure as a popular program host; praised by critics, he was avoided by viewers . . . The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Kovacs" cat="person	actor	host	winner	comedian	burial	personality">Ernie Kovacs</a>  shows were products of the time when  <b>television</b> was in its  <b>infancy</b> and experimentation was acceptable. It is doubtful that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Kovacs" cat="person	actor	host	winner	comedian	burial	personality">Ernie Kovacs</a>  would find a place on  <b>television</b> today. He was too zany, too unrestrained, too undisciplined. Perhaps  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Gould" cat="writer	person	critic">Jack Gould</a>  of ''  The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" cat="recipient	newspaper	source">New York Times</a>   '' said it best for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Kovacs" cat="person	actor	host	winner	comedian	burial	personality">Ernie Kovacs</a> , 'the fun was in  <b>trying'</b>. " <br>Other shows had greater success while using elements of Kovacs' style.  '' <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_&_Martin's_Laugh-In" cat="family">Laugh-In</a> '' producer    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Schlatter" cat="person	director	parameter	winner	producer">George Schlatter</a>    was married to  <b>actress</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolene_Brand" cat="person	actor">Jolene Brand</a> , who had appeared in Kovacs' comic troupes over the years and had been a  <b>frequent</b> participant in (or victim of) his pioneering  <b>bits</b>.

In another link between  <b>TV</b> generations, Kovacs' usual announcer (and sometimes  <b>sketch</b> participant) was a young  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" cat="network	company">NBC</a>  staffer named    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Wendell" cat="alumnus	person	personnel	announcer	soldier">Bill Wendell</a>   .
