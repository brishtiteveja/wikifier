The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_(ship)" cat="index">SS ''Manhattan''</a>  was an   oil tanker   that became the first commercial  <b>ship</b> to cross the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Passage" cat="route">Northwest Passage</a>    in  <b>1969</b>.  For this voyage she was refitted with an icebreaker    <b>bow</b>  .  Registered in the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">United States</a>    at the time, she was the largest  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>   <b>merchant vessel</b> as well as the biggest    <b>icebreaker</b>   in history.<br>The ''Manhattans route began on the east  <b>coast</b> of    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" cat="demographic">North America</a>    and transited the passage from east to west via the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baffin_Bay" cat="">Baffin Sea</a>    and    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscount_Melville_Sound" cat="">Viscount Melville Sound</a>   .  Heavy    <b>sea ice</b>   blocked the way through    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M'Clure_Strait" cat="">McClure Strait</a>   , so a more southerly route through    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales_Strait" cat="">Prince of Wales Strait</a>    and south of    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banks_Island" cat="">Banks Island</a>    was used. One  <b>single</b> token  <b>barrel</b> of  <b>crude oil</b> was loaded at    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudhoe_Bay,_Alaska" cat="place	settlement	facility">Prudhoe Bay</a>    and then the  <b>ship</b> went back.  She was escorted by the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Coast_Guard" cat="guard	services	fishery	organisation	agency	department">Canadian Coast Guard</a>    icebreaker    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCGS_John_A._Macdonald" cat="ship">CCGS ''John A. Macdonald''</a>   .<br>This route through  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Passage" cat="route">the Northwest Passage</a>  was quite  <b>controversial</b> in  <b>international relations</b> as  <b>sovereignty</b> of these waters is claimed by    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" cat="country	nation	colony	member	state">Canada</a>    and this claim has been disputed by the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">United States</a>   .  The    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada" cat="politics">Government of Canada</a>    has defined all waters in the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Arctic_Archipelago" cat="list	region">Canadian Arctic Archipelago</a>    as being   "    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Internal_Waters" cat="dispute">Canadian Internal Waters</a>   . " <br>The voyage prompted passionate discussions in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" cat="country	nation	colony	member	state">Canada</a>  about that country's    <b>sovereignty</b>   in the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic" cat="loanword">Arctic</a>   , a topic which dominated  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic" cat="loanword">Arctic</a>  policy formulated under Prime Minister    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Trudeau" cat="person	member	memoirists	leaders	alumnus	academic	writer	lawyer	companion	catholic	scholar	diarist	list">Pierre Trudeau</a>   's administration throughout the  <b>1970s</b>.  At one point during the voyage,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit" cat="group	peoples">Inuit</a>   <b>hunters</b> stopped the vessel and demanded that the vessel  <b>master</b> ask permission to cross through  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada" cat="province	subdivision	list">Canadian territory</a> , which he did, and they granted.  <b>The Canadian</b>  <b>sovereignty debate</b> generated by the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan" cat="">Manhattan</a>  is being  <b>rekindled</b> as    <b>global climate change</b>   melts multi-year  <b>sea ice</b>, making further  <b>ship</b> transits likely in the future. The question is whether the passage can be considered an international    <b>strait</b>   or not.<br>The official reason for the voyage revolved around  <b>oil</b> which had been discovered at    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudhoe_Bay,_Alaska" cat="place	settlement	facility">Prudhoe Bay</a>    in  <b>1968</b>.   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oil_exploration_and_production_companies" cat="company">Oil companies</a>  reasoned that  <b>sea transport</b> of  <b>oil</b> by  <b>icebreaking</b>  <b>supertankers</b> would be cheaper than the building of the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Alaska_Pipeline_System" cat="pipeline	establishment">Trans-Alaska Pipeline System</a>    to    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdez,_Alaska" cat="city	place">Valdez</a>   . A second attempt to  <b>cross</b> the passage in winter proved impossible, and there were numerous  <b>environmental concerns</b> with the project, so it was cancelled and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Alaska_Pipeline_System" cat="pipeline	establishment">Trans-Alaska pipeline</a>  built.<br><br>
