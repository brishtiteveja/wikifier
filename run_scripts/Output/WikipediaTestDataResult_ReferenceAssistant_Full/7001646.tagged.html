In  <b>1909</b> the  <b>Mater</b>  <b>Hospital</b> was officially recognised as a  <b>university teaching hospital</b> and is still associated with and receives students from the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_University" cat="institution	school">Queen's University</a>    Medical School.<br>It required a major  <b>refurbishment</b> to bring it up to modern  <b>standards</b>. As the first phase of a  <b>modernisation</b> programme, a new ward block and day procedures  <b>unit</b> was built at the rear of the present block, at a cost of  15 million.
