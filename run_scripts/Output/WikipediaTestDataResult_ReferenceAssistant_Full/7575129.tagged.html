 <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Sedgwick" cat="winner	president	person	recipient">Adam Sedgwick</a>  (   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_22" cat="days">22 March</a>       <b>1785</b>   " ndash;   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_27" cat="days">27 January</a>       <b>1873</b>  ) was one of the founders of modern    <b>geology</b>  .  He proposed the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonian" cat="">Devonian</a>  period   of the   geological timescale   and later the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian" cat="">Cambrian</a>    period.  The latter proposal was based on work which he did on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales" cat="region	country	nation">Welsh</a>    rock strata  .<br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Sedgwick" cat="winner	president	person	recipient">Sedgwick</a>  was born in    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dent" cat="">Dent</a>   ,    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire" cat="county">Yorkshire</a>   , the third  <b>child</b> of an  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism" cat="">Anglican</a>   <b>vicar</b>. He was educated at    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedbergh_School" cat="establishment	school">Sedbergh School</a>    and    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge" cat="establishment	institution	organisation	building">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>   .<br>He obtained his  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts" cat="degree">BA</a>  (5th   Wrangler)   from the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge" cat="institution	attraction	establishment	charity	organisation">University of Cambridge</a>    in    <b>1808</b>   and his MA in    <b>1811</b>  . His  <b>academic</b>  <b>mentors</b> at Cambridge were    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jones_(mathematician)" cat="person	wrangler	mathematician">Thomas Jones</a>    and    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dawson_(surgeon)" cat="person	mathematician">John Dawson</a>   .<br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Sedgwick" cat="winner	president	person	recipient">Sedgwick</a>  studied the  <b>geology</b> of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles" cat="">British Isles</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" cat="concept">Europe</a> . He founded the system for the classification of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian" cat="">Cambrian</a>   <b>rocks</b> and with    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roderick_Murchison" cat="member	recipient	person	scientist	burial	president	baronet	winner	soldier">Roderick Murchison</a>    worked out the order of the  <b>carboniferous</b> and underlying  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonian" cat="">Devonian</a>   <b>strata</b>. He investigated the  <b>phenomena</b> of  <b>metamorphism</b> and  <b>concretion</b>, and was the first to distinguish clearly between    <b>stratification</b>  ,    <b>jointing</b>  , and    <b>slaty cleavage</b>  . He was elected to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society" cat="body	organisation	establishment	academy	club">Fellow of the Royal Society</a>    on    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_1" cat="days">1 February</a>       <b>1821</b>  .<br>While by no means a   fundamentalist   or   evangelical   by today s standards,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Sedgwick" cat="winner	president	person	recipient">Sedgwick</a>  always maintained a  <b>fine line</b> between his  <b>science</b> and his  <b>faith</b>. His  <b>geological</b> position was    <b>catastrophist</b>  , and he believed in a  <b>succession</b> of Divine creative acts throughout the long  <b>expanse</b> of history. Any form of development that denied a direct creative action smacked as  <b>materialistic</b> and  <b>amoral</b>. For  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Sedgwick" cat="winner	president	person	recipient">Sedgwick</a> ,    <b>moral</b>   truths (the obtainment of which separates man from beast) were to be distinguished from physical  <b>truths</b>, and to combine these or blur them together could only  <b>lead</b> to  <b>disastrous consequences</b>. In fact, one s own hope for    <b>immortality</b>   may ultimately rest on it. <br>So, when    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Chambers" cat="">Robert Chambers</a>    anonymously published his own  <b>theory</b> of    <b>evolution</b>  , or development, in the  <b>book</b> ''   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestiges_of_the_Natural_History_of_Creation" cat="publication	book">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</a>   '' (   <b>1844</b>  ),  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Sedgwick" cat="winner	president	person	recipient">Sedgwick</a>  jumped at the chance to attack the  <b>book</b> in the July,    <b>1845</b>   edition of the ''   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Review" cat="magazine	publication">Edinburgh Review</a>   ''. ''Vestiges''  " comes before  with a bright, polished, and many-coloured surface, and the  <b>serpent</b> coils a false  <b>philosophy</b>, and asks them to stretch out their hands and pluck the  <b>forbidden fruit</b>, "  he wrote in his review.   Accepting the arguments in  <b>Vestiges</b> was akin to falling from  <b>grace</b> and away from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God" cat="deity">God</a>  s favor.<br>He lashed out at the  <b>book</b> in a letter to    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lyell" cat="lawyer	person	winner	burial	president	recipient	scientist	academic	geologist	baronet	member	writer">Charles Lyell</a>   , bemoaning the consequences of it conclusions.  " ...If the  <b>book</b> be true, the labours of  <b>sober</b>  <b>induction</b> are in vain;  <b>religion</b> is a lie;  <b>human law</b> is a mass of  <b>folly</b>, and a base  <b>injustice</b>;  <b>morality</b> is  <b>moonshine</b>; our labours for the  <b>black people</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" cat="">Africa</a>  were works of  <b>madmen</b>; and man and woman are only better beasts! "  Later,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Sedgwick" cat="winner	president	person	recipient">Sedgwick</a>  would add a long  <b>preface</b> to the  <b>5th edition</b> of his ''Discourse on the Studies of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge" cat="institution	attraction	establishment	charity	organisation">University of Cambridge''</a>  (   <b>1850</b>  ), including a lengthy attack on ''Vestiges'' and theories of development in  <b>general</b>.<br>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin" cat="recipient	person	salopians	burial	theorist	winner	scientist	writer	anglican	member	botanist	biologist">Charles Darwin</a>    was one of his  <b>geological</b> students and the two kept up a  <b>correspondence</b> while  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin" cat="recipient	person	salopians	burial	theorist	winner	scientist	writer	anglican	member	botanist	biologist">Darwin</a>  was aboard the ''   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Beagle" cat="ship	vessel">HMS Beagle</a>   ''.  However,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Sedgwick" cat="winner	president	person	recipient">Sedgwick</a>  never accepted the case for  <b>evolution</b> made in the '' <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species" cat="book">Origin of Species''</a>  any more than he did in the ''Vestiges''.  In response to receiving and  <b>reading</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin" cat="recipient	person	salopians	burial	theorist	winner	scientist	writer	anglican	member	botanist	biologist">Darwin</a> 's  <b>book</b>, he wrote to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin" cat="recipient	person	salopians	burial	theorist	winner	scientist	writer	anglican	member	botanist	biologist">Darwin</a>  saying:<br>: " If I did not think you a good tempered and truth-loving man I should not tell you that ... I have read your  <b>book</b> with more  <b>pain</b> than  <b>pleasure</b>.  Parts of it I admired greatly; parts I laughed at till my sides were almost  <b>sore</b>; other parts I read with absolute sorrow; because I think them utterly false and grievously mischievous.  You have  <b>deserted</b> - after a start in that  <b>tram-road</b> of all  <b>solid</b> physical  <b>truth</b> - the true method of induction ... " <br>In the same letter, once again,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Sedgwick" cat="winner	president	person	recipient">Sedgwick</a>  emphasized his distinction between the  <b>moral</b> and physical aspects of life,  " There is a  <b>moral</b> or  <b>metaphysical</b> part of  <b>nature</b> as well as a physical.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" cat="person	jew	prophets	leaders	execution	dispute">A man</a>  who denies this is deep in the  <b>mire</b> of  <b>folly</b>. "  To break this distinction would be to degrade and brutalize humanity. In a letter to another  <b>correspondent</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Sedgwick" cat="winner	president	person	recipient">Sedgwick</a>  was even harsher on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin" cat="recipient	person	salopians	burial	theorist	winner	scientist	writer	anglican	member	botanist	biologist">Darwin</a> 's  <b>book</b>, calling it  " ''utterly false'' "  and writing that  " It repudiates all  <b>reasoning</b> from  <b>final causes</b>; and seems to shut the  <b>door</b> on any view (however feeble) of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nature_deities" cat="deity">God of Nature</a>  as manifested in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritist_Codification" cat="">His works</a> . From first to last it is a dish of rank materialism cleverly cooked and served up. " <br><br>
