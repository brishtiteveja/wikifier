A  <b>variable</b> may also be declared as  <b>fully</b>  <b>dynamic</b> using the generic keyword.  In this case no value need be assigned to it at  <b>declaration</b> time<br>;Type casts:A value can be converted to another type using a cast operation.  The  <b>syntax</b> is similar the that in C++ but simplified.  Casts are always performed at  <b>runtime</b> and a specific cast  <b>operator</b> may be defined for a class.<br>;Functions:A function is a program segment that is called and performs some operations before (possibly) returning a value.  If no value is explicitly returned, the value none is returned.<br>A  <b>function</b> can be declared as returning a particular type.  The actual value returned is cast to the  <b>return type</b> at runtime.<br>;Classes:A class is an  <b>object</b> oriented type.  They may be derived from other  <b>classes</b> to form a ''class hierarchy''.  They provide a set of  <b>functions</b> and operators that manipulate instances of the  <b>class</b>.  The  <b>class</b> may take arguments and its  <b>constructor</b> is the body of the block.<br>;Access control:Like C++ and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" cat="language">Java</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido_(programming_language)" cat="language">Aikido</a>  controls access to all members of blocks.  By default membership is ''private'' but may be made  ''public'' or ''protected'' using keywords.<br>;Interfaces:Similar to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" cat="language">Java</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido_(programming_language)" cat="language">Aikido</a>  provides an  <b>interface</b>  <b>concept</b> to constitute a  <b>contract</b> to provide certain  <b>functions</b> in the  <b>class</b>.  A class may implement one or more interfaces<br>; <b>Closures</b> and coroutines:A    <b>closure</b>   in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido" cat="arts">Aikido</a>  is an  <b>object</b> that contains everything that is needed to invoke a  <b>function</b> from any point in the program.  This includes the  <b>function</b>'s  <b>static</b>  <b>link chain</b>.  A  <b>closure</b> is created by passing a  <b>function</b> name as an  <b>argument</b> or by returning it from a  <b>function</b>.  A    <b>coroutine</b>   is an extension of a  <b>closure</b> that also includes the current  <b>state</b> of a function (all data, program counter and registers).  A    <b>coroutine</b>   yields to its caller using the ''yield'' keyword.  It can be resumed inside a ''foreach'' statement or by calling the ''next()''  <b>function</b> on the closure.<br>;Polymorphic functions:Similar to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" cat="language">Java</a> , all public  <b>functions</b> in a block are be  <b>overridden</b> by a block derived from it.  This is known as ''virtual functions'' in C++.<br>;Static members:Block members may be declared ''static'' meaning that their memory resides in the outer  <b>program level</b>.  This allows them to maintain their value.<br>;Threads:A thread is a ''thread of control'' in the program and executes independently of other threads.<br>;Packages: A package is a collection of program constructs collected in one place for use by another program.  They may be used to provide libraries.<br>;Monitors:A monitor is a  <b>thread synchronization</b> object that controls access to memory and also provides a signaling facility<br>;Strings:A string is a  <b>sequence</b> of  <b>characters</b>.  Many operations are available for them including  <b>insertion</b>, searching, deletion, shifting, etc.<br>;Vectors:A vector is a sequence values of any type.  They may be manipulated and extended by built-in operations<br><br>
