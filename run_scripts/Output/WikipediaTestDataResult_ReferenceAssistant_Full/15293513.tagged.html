The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDC_Pro_Tour" cat="tournament">PDC Pro Tour</a>  is a series of non-televised    <b>darts</b>   tournaments organised by the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Darts_Corporation" cat="organisation">Professional Darts Corporation</a>    ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Darts_Corporation" cat="organisation">PDC</a> ). They comprise of    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Dart_Players_Association" cat="union	organisation">Professional Dart Players Association</a>    ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Dart_Players_Association" cat="union	organisation">PDPA</a> ) Players Championships and    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Open" cat="tournament">UK Open</a>    Regional Finals. Ten players have won more than three  <b>Pro Tour</b> titles,    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Taylor" cat="person	player	champion">Phil Taylor</a>    having won the most with 23.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_van_Barneveld" cat="player	person	recipient	champion">Raymond van Barneveld</a>    has won 10 titles since switching to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Darts_Corporation" cat="organisation">PDC</a>  in January 2006.<br>Players Championships, originally known as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Dart_Players_Association" cat="union	organisation">PDPA Players Championships</a> , are organised by the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Dart_Players_Association" cat="union	organisation">Professional Dart Players Association</a>    ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Dart_Players_Association" cat="union	organisation">PDPA</a> ) and have increased in number in recent years. They are known as  " floor  <b>tournaments</b> " , because they feature around 32  <b>darts</b> boards in close proximity on an  <b>arena</b> floor where the  <b>tournament</b> is played in the  <b>space</b> of a day.  <b>Televised</b> events differ by having  <b>just one</b>  <b>main board</b> on a  <b>stage</b> with the  <b>audience</b> and cameras situated around it.<br>Eligibility for these events are usually restricted to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Dart_Players_Association" cat="union	organisation">PDPA</a>  members only, however  <b>tournaments</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium" cat="country	member	state">Belgium</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands" cat="country	member	state">Holland</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" cat="state	republic	country	member	nation">Germany</a>  for instance often  <b>allow</b> entry to non-PDPA members who are residents of the country staging the  <b>tournament</b>. Some overseas players from the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Darts_Organisation" cat="sport	dispute	organisation">BDO</a>    take the opportunity of playing in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Darts_Corporation" cat="organisation">PDC</a>  Players Championships in their  <b>home countries</b>.<br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi" cat="">The number</a>  of Players Championships has increased in recent years. In  <b>2005</b> and  <b>2006</b>, there were just eight  <b>tournaments</b>. Several  <b>tournaments</b> which already existed, such as the Peachtree Open,  <b>Windy</b> City Open and Bobby Bourne Memorial were awarded Player  <b>Championship</b> status as the  <b>calendar</b> expanded to 20 Players Championships in  <b>2007</b>. There are set to be around 25 events in  <b>2008</b>. <br>In  <b>2004</b>, the first year of Players Championships - each  <b>tournament</b> winner received  5,000. The total  <b>prize</b> fund for each  <b>2005 event</b> was  19,600 with the champion still receiving  5,000. The  <b>prize money</b> has remained the same since.<br>The  <b>prize money</b> won in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDC_Pro_Tour" cat="tournament">Players Championship</a>  counts towards the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darts_world_rankings" cat="ranking">PDC Order of Merit</a>  which contributes to each players    <b>world ranking</b>  , so there is some significance to the events, even though they are not  <b>televised</b>.<br>During  <b>2007</b>, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Darts_Corporation" cat="organisation">PDC</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Dart_Players_Association" cat="union	organisation">PDPA</a>  added further importance to Players Championships by changing qualification criteria for major  <b>televised</b> events. A separate  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDC_Pro_Tour" cat="tournament">Players Championship</a>   <b>Order</b> of Merit was introduced which calculates players  <b>earnings</b> for these  <b>tournaments</b> only each  <b>calendar year</b>. The players who won the most  <b>money</b> (without having already made it automatically) were awarded qualifying places at the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Matchplay_(darts)" cat="tournament">World Matchplay</a>   ,    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Grand_Prix_(darts)" cat="tournament">World Grand Prix</a>    and   World Championship  . Previously, a  <b>sudden-death</b>  <b>knockout</b> qualifying  <b>tournament</b> decided the players which meant players could miss out on  <b>tournaments</b> because of unlucky matches or unlucky draws.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCW_World_Heavyweight_Championship" cat="championship">The World Championship</a> , however still maintains an  <b>additional qualifying tournament</b> - from which    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Shepherd" cat="person	player">Kirk Shepherd</a>    emerged and went on to reach the world final itself in  <b>2008</b>.<br>The    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Open" cat="tournament">UK Open</a>    is a  <b>major tournament</b> which takes place at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolton_Wanderers_F.C." cat="winner	club	member">Bolton</a> 's    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reebok_Stadium" cat="venue	building">Reebok Stadium</a>    each year in June. Prior to the televised event, there are eight Regional Open Finals stages, where the  <b>prize money</b> won is  <b>collated</b> into a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Open" cat="tournament">UK Open</a>   <b>Order</b> of Merit table which determines  <b>128</b>  <b>qualifiers</b> for the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Open" cat="tournament">UK Open</a>  finals in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolton_Wanderers_F.C." cat="winner	club	member">Bolton</a> . <br>The  <b>tournaments</b> are organised in a similar  <b>fashion</b> to the Players Championships in that 32 boards are in operation for a non-televised  " floor tournament " , completed inside one day. During the 2007-08  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Open" cat="tournament">UK Open</a> , sponsors    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rank_Group" cat="company	casino">Blue Square</a>    have  <b>streamed</b> live coverage of these Regional Finals on the  <b>internet</b>. <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize_money" cat="">Prize Money</a>  was identical to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Players'_Championship" cat="event">Player's Championship</a>   <b>prize</b> fund until the  <b>2007-08</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Open" cat="tournament">UK Open</a>  when there was increase from  19,600 to  25,000 for each of the eight finals.<br>Player's must compete in at least three  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Eight" cat="">Regional finals</a>  before being able to qualify for the televised stages. Until  <b>2007-08</b>, the  <b>tournaments</b> were open to all  <b>darts</b> players, which meant that players from both  <b>darts</b> organisations, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Darts_Corporation" cat="organisation">PDC</a>  and the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Darts_Organisation" cat="sport	dispute	organisation">BDO</a>    were able to compete. They are now restricted to PDPA members only.<br><br>
