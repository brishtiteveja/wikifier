 <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who)" cat="lord	character">The Doctor</a>  agrees to  <b>talk</b> before the  <b>torture</b>  <b>session</b> starts, and  tells  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tancredi" cat="opera">Tancredi</a>  that he is a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord" cat="telepaths	civilization	lord">Time Lord</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tancredi" cat="opera">Tancredi</a>  asks about the girl and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who)" cat="lord	character">the Doctor</a>  stalls for time, asking how  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tancredi" cat="opera">Tancredi</a>  communicates with his other selves across time.<br>The Countess gleefully talks to her husband about their their monumental  <b>theft</b> of  <b>the Mona Lisa</b>. The Count, still confused, is unimpressed; he brags about the building of the    <b>pyramid</b>  s, mapping the heavens, inventing the  <b>wheel</b> and fire, and bringing up a whole  <b>race</b> from nothing to save his own: he just wants a  <b>single life</b> and to spare the lives of his people. He hears a voice and asks his bemused  <b>spouse</b> to leave him. Once she has gone, he communicates briefly with his  <b>1505</b> self. Taking advantage of the  <b>distraction</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who)" cat="lord	character">the Doctor</a>  escapes into  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS" cat="devices">the TARDIS</a> . All the splinters of Scaroth appear and converse; there seem to be 12 of him. Before  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS" cat="devices">the TARDIS</a>  dematerialises,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who)" cat="lord	character">the Doctor</a>  hears Scaroth proclaim that  " the centuries dividing me will be undone " .  This worries him greatly.<br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romana" cat="member">Romana</a>  and Duggan, tired of waiting for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who)" cat="lord	character">the Doctor</a> , try to break into the  <b>chateau</b> and are  <b>immediately</b> captured again.  Scarlioni threatens to destroy  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" cat="street">Paris</a>  unless  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romana" cat="member">Romana</a>  examines  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Kerensky" cat="politician	person	member	minister	revolutionary	socialist	burial">Kerensky</a> 's equipment. Upon doing so, she tells Duggan that the Count can indeed destroy  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" cat="street">Paris</a>  by blasting the  <b>capital</b> into an unstabilised time field. Scarlioni, no longer in need of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Kerensky" cat="politician	person	member	minister	revolutionary	socialist	burial">Kerensky</a> , uses the  <b>machine</b> to age him to  <b>death</b> in a  <b>matter</b> of seconds.The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count" cat="count	age	title">Count</a>  says that the unstable time field has destroyed the  <b>professor</b>, and the whole of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" cat="street">Paris</a>  is next unless  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romana" cat="member">Romana</a>  tells him how to stabilise the time field.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romana" cat="member">Romana</a>  pretends not to care about the  <b>welfare</b> of  <b>humans</b> or  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" cat="street">Paris</a> , but gives in when Scarlioni threatens to have Hermann kill Duggan. Scaroth orders that Duggan be locked up while  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romana" cat="member">Romana</a>  builds a field  <b>interphase</b> stabiliser.<br>The Doctor races across  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" cat="street">Paris</a>  to the  <b>chateau</b>, where  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Countess" cat="opera">the Countess</a>  shows him the original  <b>manuscript</b> for    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet" cat="works	play">Hamlet</a>   , missing for centuries. Knowing how the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count" cat="count	age	title">Count</a>  acquired such an  <b>artifact</b>, he tells  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Countess" cat="opera">the Countess</a>  that she doesn't know her husband as well as she thinks. Berating  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Countess" cat="opera">the Countess</a>  for her  <b>willful blindness</b>, he tells her that a  <b>green</b>, one-eyed chap is ransacking the  <b>treasures</b> of the  <b>art world</b> in order to save his  <b>species</b>, the Jagoroth. Hermann arrives and takes the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord" cat="telepaths	civilization	lord">Time Lord</a>  down to meet his master, leaving  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Countess" cat="opera">the Countess</a>  to ponder. In her hidden  <b>book</b> cabinet, she takes out an ancient   Egyptian   scroll, on which is depicted a one-eyed,  <b>green</b> creature exactly as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who)" cat="lord	character">the Doctor</a>  described.<br>Down in the lab, the Doctor is angry with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romana" cat="member">Romana</a>  for cooperating, but  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romana" cat="member">Romana</a>  insists all is  <b>fine</b> - Scarlioni only wants to go back in time to  <b>reunite</b> himself. Scarlioni  <b>goes</b> to say goodbye to his wife, asking  <b>his butler</b> to kill the  <b>trio</b> any way he likes after his departure.<br>The Countess aims a  <b>gun</b> at Scarlioni and demands to know what she married. He reveals his true visage, and thanks his wife for wearing the  <b>bracelet</b>. He activates it and it kills her instantly. Soon, he says, she will never have existed.<br>Having realised the enormity of Scaroth's plans,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romana" cat="member">Romana</a>  is  <b>truly</b> sorry. He tried to put the whole  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" cat="">Earth</a>  into the time bubble by  <b>400</b> million years, but only succeeded for a few seconds, which caused those time slips. Now that he has the device she constructed, the field will be stabilised.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Doctor" cat="character	doctor">The Doctor</a>  scolds  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romana" cat="member">Romana</a> , who reveals that she has rigged it so that he will only be in the past for two minutes. The Doctor says that Scaroth needs only one  <b>minute</b> - if the Jagoroth is no longer  <b>splintered</b>, the whole of  <b>human history</b> will be up-ended. <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_(band)" cat="group">The Time</a>  Lords and Duggan escape the lab, only to be confronted by the monstrous Scaroth, training a  <b>gun</b> upon them. He knows of the limitations  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romana" cat="member">Romana</a>  has placed upon his  <b>machine</b>, but believes it makes no difference; he will still be able to prevent his  <b>spaceship</b> from exploding, thus saving his race and remaining unsplintered. He vanishes, and the  <b>machine</b>  <b>explodes</b>. The trio dash through  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" cat="street">Paris</a>  to retrieve  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS" cat="devices">the TARDIS</a> .

He explains that the  <b>explosion</b> which annihilated the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens" cat="list	race	character">Jagaroth</a>  and caused Scarlioni to splinter also caused the  <b>birth</b> of all life on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" cat="">Earth</a> . <br>Scaroth appears and calls to his brothers to stop the take off. The Doctor tells him that he can't change history, but Scaroth disagrees. Duggan punches Scaroth and knocks him out.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who)" cat="lord	character">The Doctor</a> , having berated the detective for his crude methods throughout the episode, praises him for throwing  " the most important  <b>punch</b> in  <b>history</b> " .  Duggan'Scaroth's two minutes are up and he vanishes. The others rush back into  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS" cat="devices">the TARDIS</a> . The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens" cat="list	race	character">Jagaroth</a>  ship explodes (again) on take off, releasing a huge amount of  <b>radiation</b> and  <b>heat</b> that ignites the  <b>primordial soup</b>, creating life.<br>Back at the  <b>chateau</b>, Hermann watches, aghast, as a monstrous, one-eyed creature appears in the time field. Not realising the creature is his master, he hurls an object at the  <b>machinery</b>, destroying the equipment, setting the  <b>chateau</b> on fire and blasting the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count" cat="count	age	title">Count</a>  to oblivion.<br>Back on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower" cat="building	restaurant	landmark	skyscraper	attraction">the Eiffel Tower</a> , the three friends discuss the fact that the only  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa" cat="painting	portrait">Mona Lisa</a>  to survive the fire has  " THIS IS A  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_(manga)" cat="portrayal	title">FAKE</a>  "  written on the  <b>canvas</b>.
