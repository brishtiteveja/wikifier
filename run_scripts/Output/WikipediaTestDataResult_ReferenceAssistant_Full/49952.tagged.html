 <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudence" cat="names	ethics">Prudence</a>  (lat.:prudentia) is classically considered to be a    <b>virtue</b>  , and indeed, one of the   Cardinal Virtues  .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpster" cat="container">The word</a>  comes from Old    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French" cat="language	laws">French</a>    ''prudence'' (13th century), from    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" cat="language">Latin</a>    ''prudentia'' foresight,  <b>sagacity</b>,  <b>contraction</b> of ''providentia'' foresight. It is often associated with    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom" cat="">Wisdom</a>   ,    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight" cat="source">Insight</a>   , and    <b>Knowledge</b>  .  In this case, the  <b>virtue</b> is the ability to  <b>judge</b> between  <b>virtuous</b> and vicious actions, not only in a  <b>general</b> sense, but with regard to appropriate actions at a given time and place.  Although  <b>prudence</b> itself does not perform any actions, and is concerned solely with  <b>knowledge</b>, all  <b>virtues</b> had to be regulated by it.  Distinguishing when acts are    <b>courage</b>  ous, as opposed to    <b>reckless</b>   or   cowardly  , for instance, was an act of  <b>prudence</b>.  This is why it is classified as a  <b>cardinal</b> which is to say pivotal  <b>virtue</b>.<br>Although  <b>prudence</b> would be applied to any such  <b>judgment</b>, the more difficult tasks, which distinguish a person as prudent, are those in which various  <b>goods</b> have to be weighed against each other, as when a person is determining what would be best to give  <b>charitable</b>  <b>donations</b>, or how to punish a  <b>child</b> so as to prevent repeating an offense.<br>In modern    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" cat="language">English</a>   , however, the word has become  <b>increasingly</b>  <b>synonymous</b> with  <b>cautiousness</b>.  In this sense,  <b>prudence</b> names a reluctance to take risks, which remains a  <b>virtue</b> with respect to unnecessary risks, but when unreasonably extended (i.e. over-cautiousness), can become the   vice   of  <b>cowardice</b>.   <br>In the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics" cat="book">Nichomachean Ethics</a>   ,    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle" cat="philosopher	logician	physicist	mathematician	researcher	theorist	meteorologist	defender	person	writer	biologist">Aristotle</a>    gives a lengthy account of the virtue    <b>phronesis</b>   (Greek: ϕρονησιϛ), which has traditionally been  <b>translated</b> as  "  <b>prudence</b> " , although this has become  <b>increasingly</b> problematic as the word has fallen out of common usage.  More recently ϕρονησιϛ has been translated by such terms as  "  <b>practical wisdom</b> "  or  " practical  <b>judgment</b>. "  <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudence" cat="names	ethics">Prudence</a>  was considered by the ancient   Greeks   and later on by   Christian   Philosophers, most notably    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas" cat="book">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>   , as the cause, measure and form of all  <b>virtues</b>. It is considered to be the ''auriga virtutum'' or the  <b>charioteer</b> of the  <b>virtues</b>.<br>It is the cause in the sense that the  <b>virtues</b>, which are defined to be the  perfected ability  of man as a  <b>spiritual</b> person (spiritual personhood in the classical western understanding means having    <b>intelligence</b>   and   free will  ), achieve their  perfection  only when they are founded upon  <b>prudence</b>, that is to say upon the perfected ability to make right decisions. For instance, a person can live   temperance   when he has acquired the  <b>habit</b> of deciding correctly the actions to take in response to his  <b>instinctual</b>  <b>cravings</b>.<br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudence" cat="names	ethics">Prudence</a>  is considered the measure of  <b>moral</b>  <b>virtues</b> since it provides a  <b>model</b> of  <b>ethically</b> good actions.   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy" cat="book	text	topic	poem">The work</a>  of  <b>art</b> is true and real by its  <b>correspondence</b> with the  <b>pattern</b> of its  <b>prototype</b> in the  <b>mind</b> of the  <b>artist</b>. In similar  <b>fashion</b>, the free activity of man is good by its correspondence with the  <b>pattern</b> of  <b>prudence</b>. (CITE) For instance, a  <b>stock broker</b> using his experience and all the  <b>data</b> available to him decides that it is beneficial to sell  <b>stock</b> A at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2PM" cat="group	singer	artist	band">2PM</a>  tomorrow and buy  <b>stock</b> B today. The content of the decision (e.g., the stock, amount, time and means) is the product of an act of  <b>prudence</b>, while the actual carrying out of the decision may involve other  <b>virtues</b> like  <b>fortitude</b> (doing it in spite of  <b>fear</b> of failure) and justice (doing his job well out of  <b>justice</b> to his company and his  <b>family</b>). The actual act s   <b>goodness</b>  is measured against that original decision made through  <b>prudence</b>.<br>In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek" cat="">Greek</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism" cat="terms	movement	school	loanword	tradition">Scholastic philosophy</a> ,  form  denotes that which provides a thing the specific characteristic that makes it what it is. With this  <b>language</b>,  <b>prudence</b> confers upon another  <b>virtues</b> the form of its inner  <b>essence</b>; that is, its specific  <b>character</b> as a  <b>virtue</b>. For instance, not all acts of telling the  <b>truth</b> are considered good, considered as done with the  <b>virtue</b> of  <b>honesty</b>. What makes telling the  <b>truth</b> a  <b>virtue</b> is whether it is done with  <b>prudence</b>. Telling a  <b>competitor</b> the  <b>professional</b> secrets of your company is not prudent and therefore not considered good and  <b>virtuous</b>.<br>In the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian" cat="words	terms	christian">Christian</a>  understanding, the difference between  <b>prudence</b> and   cunning   is the ends or the end in which the decision of the contents of an  <b>action</b> is made.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Christian" cat="">The Christian</a>  understanding of the world includes the existence of    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God" cat="deity">God</a>   , the    <b>natural law</b>   and    <b>moral</b>   implications of  <b>human actions</b>. In this context,  <b>prudence</b> is different from cunning in that it takes into account the  <b>supernatural</b> good. For instance, the decision of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians" cat="section">persecuted Christians</a>  to be    <b>martyr</b>  ed rather than deny their  <b>faith</b> is considered prudent. Pretending to deny their  <b>faith</b> could be considered prudent from the point of view of a  <b>non-believer</b>.<br>Judgments using reasons for  <b>evil</b> ends or using  <b>evil</b> means are considered to be made through  cunning  and  false prudence  and not through  <b>prudence</b>.<br>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributing_property" cat="district">Integral parts</a>   of  <b>virtues</b>, in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism" cat="terms	movement	school	loanword	tradition">Scholastic philosophy</a> , are those which must be present for any complete or perfect act of the  <b>virtue</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005–06_La_Liga" cat="season	league">The following</a>  are the  <b>integral</b> parts of prudence:<br>In  <b>ethics</b>, a  " prudential judgment "  is one where the circumstances must be weighed to determine the  <b>correct action</b>.  Generally, it applies to situations where two people could weigh the circumstances differently and ''ethically'' come to different conclusions.<br>For instance, in    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_war_theory" cat="ethics	doctrine	terms">Just War theory</a>   , the  <b>government</b> of a  <b>nation</b> must weigh whether the harms they suffer are more than the harms that would be produced by their going to  <b>war</b> against another  <b>nation</b> that is harming them; the decision whether to go to  <b>war</b> is therefore a  <b>prudential</b>  <b>judgment</b>. <br>In another case, a  <b>patient</b> who has a  <b>terminal illness</b> with no  <b>conventional treatment</b> may hear of an experimental treatment.  To  <b>decide</b> whether to take it would require weighing on one hand, the cost, time, possible lack of benefit, and possible  <b>pain</b>,  <b>disability</b>, and hastened  <b>death</b>, and on the other hand, the possible benefit and the benefit to others of what could be learned from his case.<br>Rules of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudence" cat="names	ethics">Prudence</a>  are designed to serve  <b>self interest</b>.  " Do not drink the  <b>cleaning</b>  <b>solution</b> "  would be a rule of  <b>prudence</b>. This rule would be not considered a moral rule because while it is not  <b>morally</b> wrong to drink  <b>cleaning</b>  <b>solution</b>, it does serve your best interest not to do so.<br><br>
