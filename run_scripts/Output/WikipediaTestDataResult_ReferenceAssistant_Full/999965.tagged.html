He loves the adventure of taking on dangerous tasks, and he  <b>hopes</b> to fulfill his mission of bringing  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_the_Enders" cat="franchise">Jehuty</a>  to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" cat="planet">Mars</a> .

Despite learning that he'd died and that a mere boy was now the Runner of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_the_Enders" cat="franchise">Jehuty</a> , she persevered through her  <b>grief</b> and helped Leo in his mission to escape Antilia.
