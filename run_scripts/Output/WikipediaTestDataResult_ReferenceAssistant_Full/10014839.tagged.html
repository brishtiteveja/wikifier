The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lloyd_(riflemaker_and_sportsman)" cat="designer	person">Lloyd Rifle</a>  was the  <b>1950s</b>  <b>brainchild</b> of English  <b>deer-stalker</b>, rifleman, metallurgist and engineer    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lloyd_(riflemaker_and_sportsman)" cat="designer	person">David Llewellyn Lloyd</a>   .  His  <b>objective</b> was to create a  <b>high-quality</b>,    <b>scope-sighted</b>  ,    <b>magazine-fed</b>   sporting    <b>rifle</b>   capable of dependably high  <b>accuracy</b> at long ranges, of retaining its  <b>zero</b> despite rough handling, and of firing modern high-intensity, flat shooting  <b>cartridges</b> such as the   .244 H " H Magnum   (which  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lloyd_(riflemaker_and_sportsman)" cat="designer	person">Lloyd himself</a>  developed) and the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.264_Winchester_Magnum" cat="cartridge">.264 Winchester Magnum</a>   .  <br>As an enthusiastic stalker of Highland    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_deer" cat="animal	mammal	species">Red deer</a>    on his  <b>family</b>'s own    <b>deer forest</b>   at   Glencassley  , and elsewhere in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands" cat="mountain	province">northern Scotland</a>  - he grassed more than 5,000  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_deer" cat="animal	mammal	species">Red deer</a>  stags in a career lasting some 60 years -  <b>Lloyd</b> sought a  <b>rifle</b> which would shoot high powered  <b>cartridges</b> giving an exceptionally flat  <b>trajectory</b> and significant long range hitting power, to make it straightforward to take shots out to 300 yards and more on very sloping, mountainous terrain, without the need for very precise range-judging.  A very early  <b>convert</b> to the use of  <b>scope</b> sights in the  <b>conservative</b> world of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" cat="country	member	nation	state	template">British</a>   <b>deerstalking</b>,  <b>Lloyd</b> was impatient with the weak  <b>scope</b> mounting systems available in the early  <b>20th century</b>, and sought a  <b>solution</b>. <br>For his preferred  <b>rifle</b>  <b>action</b>  <b>Lloyd</b> selected the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gewehr_98" cat="firearm	weapon	rifle">Mauser 98</a>      bolt-action  , for its inherent strength and proven potential for  <b>accuracy</b>, and on his  <b>rifles</b> only the  <b>bolt</b>  <b>face</b> (to suit the  <b>cartridge</b>) and the back-swept bolt handle were modified from the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauser" cat="company	firearm	rifle	manufacturer">Mauser</a>   <b>norm</b>.<br>Integral to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_rifle" cat="rifle">Lloyd rifle</a>  was a  <b>telescopic sight</b> - indeed,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lloyd_(riflemaker_and_sportsman)" cat="designer	person">Lloyd rifles</a>  came with no   iron sights  , and no provision for fitting them without some difficulty - and the majority of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lloyd_(riflemaker_and_sportsman)" cat="designer	person">Lloyd rifles</a>  were delivered to their owners fitted with fixed-power  <b>scopes</b>, usually of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X" cat="game	genre">4X</a>  or  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6X" cat="">6X</a>   <b>magnification</b>, by makers such as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habicht" cat="mountain">Habicht</a> ,    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG" cat="manufacturer	company	optics	lense">Zeiss</a>   ,    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarovski" cat="company	brand	establishment">Swarovski</a>    and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG" cat="manufacturer	company	optics	lense">Hensoldt</a> .  The  <b>scope</b> was held in a specially designed, integral, immensely strong, receiver-enshrouding  <b>mount</b> which positioned it very low over the  <b>action</b>, and gripped both the  <b>scope</b> and the  <b>rifle</b>  <b>action</b> in massive  <b>rings</b> of  <b>steel</b>.  <b>Lloyd</b> held UK  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent" cat="">Patent</a>  Number 646419 for this  <b>design</b>. <br>With this  <b>scope</b> attachment - indeed, ''integration'' - system,  <b>Lloyd</b>'s intention was to create a  <b>rifle</b> which was, so far as humanly possible, immune to the shocks, bumps and jars that so often knocked the scopes on other rifles seriously out of alignment.  The objective was to have a  <b>rifle</b> which, once completed, could be  <b>zeroed</b> for a selected  <b>cartridge</b> load and a chosen  <b>zero</b> distance, and which would faithfully hold that  <b>zero</b> from outing to outing, and even from one  <b>shooting</b> season to another.   " I want a stable platform from which to shoot, "   <b>Lloyd</b> said.  In his  <b>quest</b> for this tenacity of  <b>zero</b>, he was largely successful, and many of his customers reported that they had never found it necessary to make any adjustment whatsoever to their rifles' sights over many years of use.  There are also reports of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lloyd_(riflemaker_and_sportsman)" cat="designer	person">Lloyd rifles</a>  having successfully survived serious mishaps such as falls from considerable heights, and even being run over by vehicles, without losing zero.<br>Most of  <b>Lloyd</b>'s barrels were made under  <b>contract</b> by    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickers" cat="company	manufacturer">Vickers Armstrong Ltd.</a>    and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauser" cat="company	firearm	rifle	manufacturer">Mauser</a>   <b>98</b> actions were prepared by    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland" cat="region	state	polity">Holland</a>   "   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland" cat="region	state	polity">Holland</a>   .  Although  <b>Lloyd</b> enjoyed  <b>sourcing</b> the  <b>walnut</b> for the rifles' stocks himself, visiting growers and dealers across  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" cat="concept">Europe</a> , many of the  <b>rifles</b> were stocked-up by Wisemans.  In making  <b>rifles</b>,  <b>Lloyd</b> also had close working relationships with the firms of    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._W._Greener" cat="company	manufacturer">W. W.
