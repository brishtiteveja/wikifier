It was so named because of its similarity to the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Terror" cat="">Red Terror</a>    in    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic" cat="state	country">Soviet Russia</a>    in both purpose and effect.<br>In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919" cat="">March 1919</a> , a  <b>clique</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism" cat="ideology">Communists</a> , in  <b>collusion</b> with Social Democrats, took control of the  <b>Hungarian government</b>, after president    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihály_Károlyi" cat="minister	president	person	socialist">Mihály Károlyi</a>    stepped aside.  Soon after, the  <b>communists</b>, led by    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Béla_Kun" cat="journalist	person	rehabilitation	jew	minister	convert	politician	ruler	atheist	victim">Béla Kun</a>   , staged a  <b>coup</b> and seized  <b>absolute</b>  <b>power</b>, proclaiming the establishment of the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Soviet_Republic" cat="disestablishment	state	republic	country">Hungarian Soviet Republic</a>   .<br>Committed  <b>ideologues</b> within the party, such as    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/György_Lukács" cat="dispute	politician	philosopher	member	writer	minister	theorist	convert	jew	person	critic">Georg Lukács</a>    and    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibor_Szamuely" cat="jew	journalist	person	politician	communist	personnel">Tibor Szamuely</a>   , argued for the  <b>necessity</b> of  "    <b>revolutionary terror</b>  . "   With their support, József Cserny organized a detachment of some 200  <b>agents</b> known as  "  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin_Boys" cat="">Lenin Boys</a>  "  (''Lenin-fiúk''), who sought out and crushed  " counter-revolutionary "  activities in the Hungarian  <b>countryside</b>.  Similar groups operated within  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest" cat="demographic	nickname	jew	words">Budapest</a> .  <br>Within two months of taking  <b>power</b>, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism" cat="ideology">Communist</a>   <b>leadership</b> tried to restore  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary" cat="state	member	country	republic">Hungary</a>  to its imperial pre-World  <b>War</b> I boundaries, first by invading    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia" cat="">Czechoslovakia</a>   , and when that  <b>invasion</b> failed, turning their troops on the    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transylvania" cat="country	region	dispute">Transylvanian</a>    territories in    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania" cat="member	state	monarchy	country	republic">Romania</a>   .  These unsuccessful adventures, as well as a string of failed domestic reforms, dampened popular support for the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism" cat="ideology">Communists</a> , and on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_24" cat="days">June 24</a>  the Social  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy" cat="ideology">Democrats</a>  attempted to  <b>regain</b> control of the  <b>government</b>.  This  <b>attempted coup</b> failed, and in its  <b>wake</b> the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism" cat="ideology">Communist</a>   <b>leadership</b> carried out a string of  <b>terror</b> reprisals to  <b>quash</b> opposition and eliminate the strongest opponents to their  <b>regime</b>.   "  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requisition" cat="">Requisition</a>  patrols "   looted homes.  The  <b>paramilitary groups</b> arrested putative or real enemies.  Numerous atrocities, executions and crimes have been recorded.<br>According to a  <b>1922</b> report by lawyer Albert Váry, the  <b>terror</b> claimed  <b>590</b> murdered victims; other sources have placed the number of dead between  <b>370</b> and  <b>587</b>.<br>The    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Soviet_Republic" cat="disestablishment	state	republic	country">Hungarian Soviet Republic</a>    fell in the first week of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919" cat="">August 1919</a> , when  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language" cat="language">Romanian</a>  forces deployed to  <b>fend</b> off the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language" cat="language">Hungarian</a>   <b>invasion</b> pushed all the way into  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest" cat="demographic	nickname	jew	words">Budapest</a> .   <b>Kun</b> escaped into  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" cat="country	nation	republic	state">Russia</a> ;  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibor_Szamuely" cat="jew	journalist	person	politician	communist	personnel">Szamuely</a>  fled to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria" cat="state	country	republic	winner">Austria</a>  but was caught and killed there.  József Cserny was arrested and tried in  <b>November 1919</b>; the Hungarian  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_association" cat="association	organization">Bar Association</a>  refused to defend him at  <b>trial</b>, so a  <b>lawyer</b> was appointed by the  <b>court</b>.  He was  <b>executed</b> in December.<br>As was common in the  <b>political unrest</b> of the  <b>20th century</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Terror" cat="">the Red Terror</a>  was answered by a  <b>wave</b> of counter-reprisals once the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism" cat="ideology">Communist</a>   <b>leadership</b> fled.
