Resolution to imbibe less goes awry ' already<br>Myriad of conflicting  <b>medical studies</b> are enough to drive this  <b>writer</b> to  <b>drink</b><br><br>The  <b>fruitcake</b>'s been digested, the  <b>gift cards</b> are empty, and now it's time to  <b>face</b> the most grueling holiday task of all: the annual reassessment. Do I  <b>need to</b>  <b>exercise</b> more? Spend less? Set aside more  <b>quality time</b> for friends and family? The resolution list goes on and on ' much like that interminable  <b>karaoke</b> version of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Baby" cat="song	singles">'Santa Baby'</a>  at this year's holiday party.<br><br>Unfortunately, since I was the one holding the  <b>microphone</b>, this year's resolution seems painfully clear: Cut back on the  <b>alcohol intake</b>.<br><br>Not that I drink a lot ' usually just a  <b>glass</b> of  <b>wine</b> with  <b>dinner</b>, if that ' but I <b>'ve</b> read that even one  <b>drink</b> a day can adversely affect my  <b>health</b>.<br><br>Also, a recent study by the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic" cat="organization	hospital">Mayo Clinic</a>  found that  <b>women</b>'s bodies are less adept at breaking down  <b>alcohol</b> than men's. As a result, the more we drink, the more we risk  <b>heart disease</b>,  <b>cancer</b>,  <b>cirrhosis</b> of the  <b>liver</b>, and, perhaps the most chilling  <b>side effect</b> of all ' kissing our  <b>skinny jeans</b> goodbye forever.<br><br>But how much  <b>alcohol</b> is too much? There's the rub.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy" cat="">The answer</a>  seems to depend on which study you read.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic" cat="organization	hospital">The Mayo Clinic</a>  study says one  <b>drink</b> a day is OK for 'younger  <b>women</b> who aren't planning a  <b>pregnancy'</b> and that  <b>'postmenopausal</b>  <b>women</b> should limit themselves to less.' But what about those of us who don't fit in either category?<br><br>Looking for a definitive answer, I turned to another study, this one conducted by a group of  <b>doctors</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stony_Brook_University" cat="university	institution">Stony Brook University</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a> . But their  <b>finding</b> that drinking three glasses of red wine a week reduces the  <b>risk</b> of  <b>colorectal cancer</b> only confused matters further.<br><br>Who to believe?<br>Should I cut back on  <b>alcohol</b> entirely in order to  <b>fend</b> off  <b>heart disease</b>,  <b>liver</b> problems and dreaded  <b>weight gain</b> (not to mention potential  <b>blackmail</b> opportunities by family, friends and co-workers) or suck down three or more glasses a week to keep the  <b>colorectal cancer</b> at bay? <br><br>Or should I listen to the  <b>doctors</b> the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Gothenburg" cat="institution	university">Goteborg University</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden" cat="country	state">Sweden</a> , who found that  <b>mice</b> that had  <b>ingested</b> low levels of  <b>alcohol</b> on a daily basis showed a significantly  <b>lower risk</b> of developing  <b>rheumatoid arthritis</b> than  <b>mice</b> that just drank  <b>water</b>. Obsessed, I started digging through  <b>medical journals</b> and  <b>online health</b> stories until the studies began to stack up like  <b>swizzle sticks</b> at a company-hosted bar.<br><br>In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" cat="capital	port	city	place">London</a> , researchers found that people who drank  <b>alcohol</b> have a  <b>lower risk</b> of developing non- <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma" cat="disorder">Hodgkin's lymphoma</a> , but the  <b>risk</b> of  <b>cancer</b> of the mouth, esophagus and liver actually increases.<br><br>At  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University" cat="university	institution">Ohio State University</a> , a study showed that drinking moderately (such as a couple of drinks a day) improved the  <b>memories</b> of  <b>laboratory rats</b>, although a study at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Missouri" cat="university	institution">University of Missouri</a>  declared that  <b>alcohol</b> hindered  <b>academic</b> success.<br><br>Live longer so you can  <b>die</b> young<br>Adding it all up, it seems that by drinking  <b>alcohol</b> I can both reduce my  <b>chances</b> of  <b>heart disease</b> and increase my  <b>risk</b> for  <b>high blood pressure</b>, fend off  <b>dementia</b> while upping my  <b>chances</b> for  <b>brain damage</b>, boost my  <b>memory</b> at the same time that I become more  <b>stupid</b>, avoid  <b>lymphoma</b> while veering towards  <b>breast</b> and  <b>liver cancer</b>, and in  <b>general</b>, both live longer and die younger.<br><br>In other words,  <b>alcohol</b> is every  <b>bit</b> the  <b>hazy</b>  <b>hypocritical</b>  <b>demon</b> it's always been (especially when there's a  <b>microphone</b> involved). So this year, I <b>'m</b> taking another resolution route altogether. Instead of squelching my  <b>alcohol intake</b>, I <b>'m</b> going to cut out  <b>karaoke</b> ' and perhaps limit my  <b>medical studies</b> to  <b>just one</b> per day with dinner, if that.<br><br>
