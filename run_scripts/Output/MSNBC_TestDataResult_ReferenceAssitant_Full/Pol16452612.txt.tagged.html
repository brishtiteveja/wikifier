Evolving  <b>presidential</b> preferences<br>How will  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">American</a>  voters compensate in the next search for a  <b>president</b>?<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington" cat="recipient	member	farmer	chancellor	congressman	person	president	officer	writer	planter	candidate	episcopalian	general">WASHINGTON</a>  - Now that the  <b>38th</b>  <b>president</b> has been  <b>laid to rest</b>, the  <b>capital</b> can take up the main  <b>business</b> of 2007: trying to figure out who will be the  <b>44th</b>.  What type of leader does the  <b>country</b> want? Here is my sense of it, based on talking to  <b>politicians</b>, strategists and voters here and around the  <b>nation</b>.<br><br>No  <b>ideologues</b>, please<br>There was a time when  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" cat="convert	owner	alumnus	aviator	candidate	executive	republican	president	industrialist	person	politician	player	methodists	officer	episcopalian	recipient	nominee	speaker">President George W. Bush</a> 's  <b>ideological</b>  <b>certitude</b> was politically appealing and perhaps functionally necessary.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronism" cat="">That time</a>  has long since passed. The country is tired, even  <b>fearful</b>, of leaders with  <b>fervent</b> beliefs that seem impervious to new (or even old) facts. Voters see the war in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  as an  <b>'idea</b>,' not a solution ' and Americans do not like ideas that do not work.  Voters likely will view  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" cat="convert	owner	alumnus	aviator	candidate	executive	republican	president	industrialist	person	politician	player	methodists	officer	episcopalian	recipient	nominee	speaker">Bush</a> 's  <b>'surge'</b> of troops into  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  as new  <b>evidence</b> of failure, and the dangers of a leader who depends on preconceived ideas.<br><br>Serious  <b>student</b><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election" cat="convention">Presidential elections</a>  are a never-ending series of mid-course  <b>corrections</b>. Voters look to compensate for the  <b>leadership</b>  <b>weaknesses</b> of the  <b>incumbent</b>. An example comes from the life and career of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford" cat="member	president	figure	leaders	survivor	person	center	personnel	episcopalian	candidate	lawyer	nominee	recipient	republican	scout	player	officer	alumnus">Gerald Ford</a> . In  <b>1976</b>, voters wanted a pure  <b>antidote</b> to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon" cat="state	terms">Richard Nixon</a> 's  <b>paranoid</b>  <b>megalomania</b>. Once  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford" cat="member	president	figure	leaders	survivor	person	center	personnel	episcopalian	candidate	lawyer	nominee	recipient	republican	scout	player	officer	alumnus">Ford</a>  pardoned  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon" cat="state	terms">Nixon</a> , he could not be that candidate. Instead, Americans chose  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter" cat="">Jimmy Carter</a> , a  <b>peanut</b>  <b>farmer</b> who had never worked in Washington, and who promised never to lie to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans" cat="group">the American people</a> . The  <b>counterpoint</b> thinking continues. Voters in  <b>2008</b> are going to want someone who prides himself (or herself) on spending time in the  <b>library</b> ' who has a hands-on  <b>curiosity</b> about the details.<br><br>Washington experience not necessary<br>Voters these  <b>days</b> not only do not value Washington experience ' or any office-holding experience ' it can make them suspicious. That is what strategists and polltakers for  <b>Sen.</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Bayh" cat="senator	secretary	alumnus	person	democrat	episcopalian	lawyer">Evan Bayh</a>  found when they studied whether he should run for  <b>president</b>. They found that his remarkably deep resume ' the son of a  <b>senator</b>, he was the  <b>'boy</b>  <b>governor'</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana" cat="state">Indiana</a>  before going to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate" cat="house">Senate</a>  ' was as handicap. Americans always are dubious about the  <b>capital</b>, but that sentiment seems  <b>particularly</b> strong.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Bayh" cat="senator	secretary	alumnus	person	democrat	episcopalian	lawyer">Bayh</a>  decided not to run. '`Washington' doesn't make the case,' said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Pfeiffer" cat="person	personnel	alumnus">Dan Pfeiffer</a> , who worked for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Bayh" cat="senator	secretary	alumnus	person	democrat	episcopalian	lawyer">Bayh</a> .<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation" cat="">No more</a>  boomer obsessions<br>Not all  <b>elections</b> are about change, but  <b>2008</b> will be. Americans are moderately upbeat about the country's prospects, but  <b>deeply</b>  <b>worried</b> about the world ' and they have come to realize that they can't separate one from the other.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunt" cat="terms">One thing</a>  for sure, says  <b>Pfeiffer</b>, voters are tired of arguing about the  <b>culture</b> of the  <b>1960s</b> and other Boomer issues.   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There" cat="">'There</a>  is a sense that  <b>the 2004 election</b> was too much about who did or did not do what in Vietnam,' said  <b>Pfeiffer</b>, referring to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush_presidential_campaign,_2004" cat="campaign">Bush campaign</a>  against  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry" cat="senator	person	lawyer	recipient	alumnus	attorney	activist	officer	democrat	politician	survivor	candidate	issue	personnel	brat	nominee">Sen.

A shrewd  <b>student</b> of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">American</a>  mood, Schumer is aiming in the right direction. The next president will need to show that he or she understands that family.<br>
