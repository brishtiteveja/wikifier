Upgrade makes  <b>aging</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" cat="planet">Mars</a>   <b>rovers</b> smarter<br> <b>Engineers</b> transmitted new  <b>software</b> to the rovers' onboard computers<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" cat="train	introduction">LOS ANGELES</a>  - The  <b>twin</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Exploration_Rover" cat="vehicle	list	winner	mission">Mars rovers</a>  are getting wiser with age.<br><br> <b>Engineers</b> have transmitted new  <b>flight</b>  <b>software</b> to the rovers' onboard  <b>computers</b> ' just in time for the third  <b>anniversary</b> of their landing.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software" cat="">The software</a>  is aimed at boosting their  <b>intelligence</b> and  <b>independence</b> so that they can roll around the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" cat="planet">Red Planet</a>  with less help from  <b>humans</b>.<br><br>"We're teaching an  <b>old dog</b> new tricks," said John Callas, the  <b>mission</b>  <b>project manager</b> with the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory" cat="landmark	establishment	site	building">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> , the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA" cat="agency">NASA</a>  agency in charge of the  <b>rovers</b>.<br><br>Among the rovers' new skills is the ability to automatically recognize and transmit to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" cat="">Earth</a>   <b>photographs</b> that they take of swirling  <b>dust devils</b> or floating  <b>clouds</b>. They can also independently  <b>decide</b> whether it is safe to extend its  <b>robotic</b>  <b>arm</b> to  <b>sample</b> a piece of  <b>rock</b>.<br><br>Before,  <b>scientists</b> had to painstakingly  <b>dissect</b>  <b>thousands</b> of images just to find the  <b>frames</b> they need and decide for the rovers whether to use their arms. The  <b>high-tech</b>  <b>upgrades</b> should help save time ' as much as a day because  <b>scientists</b> on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" cat="">Earth</a>  don't have to study a rock before sending commands to the  <b>robot</b> to pick it up.<br><br>If successful, the changes could get incorporated into future  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Mars" cat="">Mars missions</a> .<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Exploration_Rover" cat="vehicle	list	winner	mission">Spirit and Opportunity</a>  were also fitted with a new  <b>navigation</b> system that allows them to think several steps ahead when faced with an obstacle, allowing them to back out of a  <b>dead end</b> or even  <b>navigate</b> a  <b>maze</b> on their own, Callas said. The  <b>geologic</b> robots have previously  <b>tackled</b> one problem at a time.<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_(rover)" cat="">Spirit</a>  landed three years ago Wednesday and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_(rover)" cat="">Opportunity</a>  on Jan. 24, 2004. Entering their fourth year of  <b>exploration</b>, both  <b>golf</b> cart-sized  <b>vehicles</b> have long outlasted their  <b>missions</b>, originally planned for about three months. While  <b>scientists</b> are impressed by the rovers' longevity, they admit the  <b>robots</b> could die at any time.<br><br>The rovers' biggest accomplishment is  <b>uncovering</b>  <b>geologic</b>  <b>evidence</b> that  <b>water</b> once flowed on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" cat="planet">Mars</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_(rover)" cat="">Spirit</a>  is currently studying  <b>rocks</b> and  <b>soil samples</b> near a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" cat="planet">Martian</a>  ridge while  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_(rover)" cat="">Opportunity</a>  is circling the rim of a massive crater for possible ways in.<br>
