Va.</b> - One year ago  <b>Tuesday</b>, the nation was holding its  <b>breath</b> for 13 miners who were trapped deep inside the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago_Mine_disaster" cat="person">Sago Mine</a>  near  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckhannon,_West_Virginia" cat="seats	city">Buckhannon</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia" cat="state">W. Va</a> .<br><br>As it turned out, 12 of the 13 miners never made it out alive.<br><br>In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia" cat="state">West Virginia</a>   <b>Tuesday</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago_Mine_disaster" cat="person">Randal McCloy</a> , the lone survivor of the  <b>disaster</b>, joined the families of the  <b>12 men</b> who died ' to remember them and the  <b>nightmare</b> that began one year ago.<br><br>"I'm just sick when I think ' every day when I think how those men had to die and it makes me sick," says Debbie Hamner whose husband died in the mine.<br><br>Since  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago_Mine_disaster" cat="person">Sago</a> , both  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia" cat="state">West Virginia</a>  and the  <b>federal government</b> have passed new mine safety laws. But in the mines themselves, little has changed.<br><br>There's still no  <b>better way</b> to communicate with miners below ground;<br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless" cat="">Wireless communications</a>  won't be required until  <b>2009</b>;<br>Electronic  <b>tracking systems</b> for miners are still on the  <b>drawing board</b>;<br>Underground  <b>emergency</b> safe rooms are still not required by  <b>law</b>; and<br> <b>Mines</b> have another year to position more rescue teams.<br>Davitt McAteer is a mine safety expert who once ran the government's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mine_Safety_and_Health_Administration" cat="">Mine Safety and Health Administration</a>  and led  <b>West</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia" cat="place">Virginia</a> 's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago_Mine_disaster" cat="person">Sago Mine</a>  investigation.<br><br>"We  <b>need to</b> have a way to communicate with trapped miners," McAteer says. "We  <b>need to</b> protect trapped miners until we can get to them, and we  <b>need to</b> have a way that we can provide them with the  <b>breathing</b>  <b>apparatus</b> and the  <b>air</b> system so they can stay alive."  <br><br>What has changed in mine  <b>safety</b> since the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago_Mine_disaster" cat="person">Sago</a>  tragedy:  <br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improve" cat="">Improved</a>   <b>emergency</b> procedures and training is now required;<br>There are more federal mine inspectors and tougher fines for safety violations; and<br>Mines must now  <b>notify</b> the federal  <b>government</b> within 15 minutes of an  <b>accident</b>.<br>Still not required, though are underground emergency safe rooms.<br><br>The  <b>union</b> representing many of the  <b>nation</b>'s 73,000  <b>coal miners</b> says it's a sign of priorities.<br><br>"There's still just an attitude out there that  <b>production</b> comes first and safety is a convenient thing and it comes second," says Dennis O'Dell of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Mine_Workers" cat="worker	miner">United Mine Workers of America</a> .<br><br>These are  <b>boom times</b> for the  <b>coal industry</b>, producing a record 1.17 billion  <b>tons</b> of  <b>coal</b> in  <b>2006</b>, but also the highest  <b>death toll</b> in 11 years.<br>
