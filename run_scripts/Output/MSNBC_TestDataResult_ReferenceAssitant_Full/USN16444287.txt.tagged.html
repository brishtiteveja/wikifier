She said Shehadeh's  <b>visa waiver</b> could have been denied because 'he could have a  <b>criminal record</b>, or it could be a terrorism issue.'<br><br>The  <b>detention</b> follows a series of similar incidents involving  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim" cat="muslim">Muslim</a>  passengers, according to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_American–Islamic_Relations" cat="dispute	group	organization">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> .<br><br>In October, an  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulama" cat="role	words	occupation">Islamic scholar</a>  from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" cat="nation	member	country	state">South Africa</a>  was denied entry at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_International_Airport" cat="airport	building	airfield">San Francisco International Airport</a> .

'I  <b>mean</b>, we're Muslims, and we travel a lot.

'But now I can't wait for when I leave here. The mentality is not what it was like beforehand.'<br>
