 MERGER &QL; By ALEX BERENSON &QC; &LR; &QL; &UR; c.2000  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_The_New_York_Times_Company" cat="list">N.Y. Times News Service</a>  &QC; &LR; &QL; &UR; &LR; Back in January, when  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" cat="">Internet</a>  stocks were hot,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="company	disestablishment">America Online</a>  agreed to buy  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a>  with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="company	disestablishment">AOL</a>   <b>stock</b>. The deal, if approved by  <b>regulators</b>, would leave  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="company	disestablishment">AOL</a>   <b>shareholders</b> with 55 percent of the merged  <b>company</b>, even though  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a> 's  <b>revenue</b> and  <b>cash flow</b> are far greater.    Since then,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="company	disestablishment">AOL</a> 's  <b>stock</b> has fallen by almost a third, destroying most of the  <b>premium</b> the  <b>company</b> had offered for control of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a> . So a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a>   <b>shareholder</b> might conclude that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="company	disestablishment">America Online</a> 's chairman,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Case" cat="person	alumnus">Stephen Case</a> , had  <b>bamboozled</b> his  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a>  counterpart,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_M._Levin" cat="owner	alumnus	executive	person	jew	philanthropist">Gerald Levin</a> , into taking  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="company	disestablishment">AOL</a> 's  <b>shares</b> at the worst possible time.   ``Short term, anyone objective would say probably Steve got the better part of the deal,'' said Larry Haverty, a senior  <b>vice president</b> at State Street Research in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston" cat="settlement	seats	place	town	city">Boston</a>  and a  <b>longtime</b>  <b>media</b>  <b>investor</b>.   But Haverty, like many other  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a>   <b>shareholders</b> and  <b>industry</b> analysts, hardly cares. With the  <b>merger</b> likely to be completed later this month, he predicts that the merged  <b>company</b> will grow quickly by combining  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="company	disestablishment">AOL</a> 's  <b>marketing</b> skills and captive base of  <b>online users</b> with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a> 's huge  <b>library</b> of  <b>films</b>,  <b>magazines</b> and the like and its relationships with major  <b>advertisers</b>.   ``The deal strategically and financially makes all the sense in the world,'' Haverty said. ``Five years out, if you're a  <b>shareholder</b> in this  <b>company</b>, you're going to be a happy camper.''   That view is widely shared. ``Strategically, it makes a lot of sense,'' said Tom Wolzien of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_Bernstein" cat="">Sanford C. Bernstein</a> . ``These companies fill the holes of the other one. They're subscription-advertising combo models. The  <b>reality</b> is the pieces are very compatible.''   To be sure, the recent  <b>history</b> of  <b>big media</b> mergers is hardly  <b>comforting</b> for  <b>shareholders</b> in either  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="company	disestablishment">AOL</a>  or  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" cat="company	subsidiary">Disney</a>  stumbled badly after it bought Capital Cities/ABC in  <b>1996</b>, and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a>  stagnated for five years after it was created in  <b>1990</b> by the  <b>merger</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" cat="person	recipient	subsidiary	magazine">Time</a>  and  <b>Warner</b>. ``Huge deals are really hard to do and create a lot of  <b>uncertainty</b>,'' said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_McNamee" cat="alumnus	person	member">Roger McNamee</a>  of  <b>Integral</b> Capital, which sold its 404,000  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="company	disestablishment">AOL</a>   <b>shares</b> the day the  <b>merger</b> was announced.   But if the merged  <b>company</b> can overcome that  <b>hurdle</b>, it will have big advantages over  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" cat="company	subsidiary">Disney</a>  and other  <b>traditional media</b>  <b>companies</b>, which are still struggling to figure out how they can  <b>profit</b> from the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" cat="">Internet</a> , said Jessica Reif of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_Lynch" cat="dealer	company	banks">Merrill Lynch</a> .   ``Given the multiple  <b>distribution</b>  <b>platforms</b> that they have, it's obviously a very powerful  <b>consumer</b>  <b>engine</b>,'' Reif said. ``There's a reason that you see  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" cat="company	subsidiary">Disney</a>  and to a lesser extent  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" cat="network	company">NBC</a>  screaming in Washington.''   John Schreiber, an assistant  <b>portfolio manager</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_Capital_Group" cat="family	company">Janus</a>  Capital, the  <b>mutual fund</b>  <b>company</b> that is  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a> 's largest  <b>shareholder</b>, with more than 120 million  <b>shares</b>, said the companies had already begun to demonstrate how they would work together. For example,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="company	disestablishment">AOL</a>  has  <b>pitched</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a> 's  <b>magazines</b> to its users, resulting in hundreds of  <b>thousands</b> of new  <b>subscriptions</b>. And the companies are trying to sell big  <b>advertisers</b> on  <b>deals</b> that will reach both  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="company	disestablishment">America Online</a>  users and the people who watch  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner_Cable" cat="company	subsidiary">Time Warner cable</a>  channels and read its  <b>magazines</b>, Schreiber said.   ``Once the  <b>merger</b> closes, I think you'll see some very powerful cross-promotional  <b>deals</b> across all of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a> 's  <b>advertisers</b>,'' he said.   Schreiber also says the  <b>risk</b> of  <b>cultural</b> clashes between the companies is limited, because the  <b>companies</b> disclosed publicly where top executives would stand in the combined  <b>company</b> only a few weeks after the  <b>merger</b> was announced. So people who feel their responsibilities have been diminished have had months to look for new jobs, and some have already left, he said.   Given the strength he sees in the combined  <b>company</b>, Schreiber said the question of whether  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_M._Levin" cat="owner	alumnus	executive	person	jew	philanthropist">Levin</a>  could have negotiated a better deal with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="company	disestablishment">America Online</a>  is  <b>moot</b>.  <b>Shares</b> in  <b>cable companies</b> like  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast" cat="dispute	company	provider">Comcast</a>  have fallen 15 percent or more this year, while  <b>big media</b>  <b>companies</b> have been flat or up slightly. So ``it's not as if  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a>  shareholders have lost out on a great deal of upside,'' Schreiber said.  <br>
