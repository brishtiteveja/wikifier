Assad, on his first trip abroad since becoming president in July, also dealt with the issue of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  in the talks with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosni_Mubarak" cat="dispute	person	president	survivor	politician	alumnus	muslim	leaders	marshals	candidate">Mubarak</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Egypt)" cat="">Egyptian Foreign Minister</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amr_Moussa" cat="diplomat	representative	person	alumnus">Amr Mussa</a>  said.   The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria" cat="country	state	republic	dispute">Syrian</a>  leader's visit came on a fourth day of clashes that have raged in  <b>the West Bank</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip" cat="">Gaza Strip</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem" cat="opera">Jerusalem</a> , leaving more than two dozen  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_people" cat="group	citizen	person">Palestinians</a>  dead.   ``There is complete agreement (between  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosni_Mubarak" cat="dispute	person	president	survivor	politician	alumnus	muslim	leaders	marshals	candidate">Mubarak</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafez_al-Assad" cat="leaders	person	head	general	president	politician">Assad</a> ) as to the  <b>seriousness</b> of the situation and that the negative  <b>repercussions</b> would adversely effect the  <b>peace</b> process, which is in itself in a very precarious  <b>state</b>,'' Moussa said.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad" cat="politician	person	ophthalmologist	leaders	president	head">Assad</a> , 35, has focused on  <b>domestic issues</b> since his father,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafez_al-Assad" cat="leaders	person	head	general	president	politician">Hafez Assad</a> , died in June after 30 years in  <b>power</b>. He has taken steps to  <b>modernize</b>  <b>his nation</b>'s  <b>bureaucracy</b> and revive its  <b>stagnant economy</b>.   ``This was the first meeting of the first visit of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" cat="president">President</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad" cat="politician	person	ophthalmologist	leaders	president	head">Bashar Assad</a>  after the  <b>funeral</b> of his father, so it was only normal for the discussions to have a  <b>general</b>  <b>tone</b> ... in addition to certain specifics of special importance to both countries and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world" cat="classification">the Arab world</a> ,'' Moussa said.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezequiel_Cabeza_De_Baca" cat="person">The late</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_Syria" cat="politics	list	president	politician">Syrian president</a>  rarely traveled abroad. In his last few years, however, he had sent  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad" cat="politician	person	ophthalmologist	leaders	president	head">Bashar</a> , educated as an  <b>eye doctor</b>, on foreign trips as part of his grooming to become president.   Prospects appear dim for progress on either the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria" cat="country	state	republic	dispute">Syrian</a>  or  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_people" cat="group	citizen	person">Palestinian</a>   <b>peace</b> track. The  <b>deadlock</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel" cat="citizen">Palestinian-Israeli</a>  talks is exacerbated by the worst  <b>violence</b> in four years.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria" cat="country	state	republic	dispute">Syria</a> 's government-run  <b>media</b> said last week that no progress could be expected now because of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2006" cat="">U.S. elections</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel" cat="">Israeli Prime Minister</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Barak" cat="politician	jew	person	recipient	member	leaders	commander	alumnus	minister	chief">Ehud Barak</a> 's precarious situation as leader of a  <b>minority government</b>.   Syrian-Israeli  <b>peace negotiations</b> broke down in January, with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria" cat="country	state	republic	dispute">Syria</a>  demanding a full withdrawal from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights" cat="section	dispute	territory	fields">the Golan Heights</a> , a strategic  <b>plateau</b> captured by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" cat="republic	country	state	words">Israel</a>  in  <b>1967</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" cat="republic	country	state	words">Israel</a>  insists on waiting to settle borders until it knows what it will gain by returning  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights" cat="section	dispute	territory	fields">Golan</a>  land.   Assad has made it clear he  <b>intends</b> to  <b>follow</b> his father's course in any negotiations with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" cat="republic	country	state	words">Israel</a> .    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosni_Mubarak" cat="dispute	person	president	survivor	politician	alumnus	muslim	leaders	marshals	candidate">Mubarak</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafez_al-Assad" cat="leaders	person	head	general	president	politician">Assad</a>  met after a week when  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" cat="country	nation	republic	state">Russia</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" cat="nation	country	state	republic	member">France</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan" cat="country	state">Jordan</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen" cat="country	dispute	state	republic">Yemen</a>  sent planes to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad" cat="capital	community	place	establishment">Baghdad</a> , challenging  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Iraq" cat="disestablishment	abuse	resolution	sanction	cause	establishment">U.N. sanctions</a>  imposed on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  after its  <b>1990</b>  <b>invasion</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait" cat="state	country">Kuwait</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  is hoping other  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world" cat="classification">Arab countries</a>  will  <b>follow</b>, despite  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>  complaints, easing its  <b>isolation</b>.   Moussa said the presidents discussed the situation in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  and would return to it Monday. However, he would not comment on whether  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria" cat="country	state	republic	dispute">Syria</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt" cat="republic	state	country	dispute	monarchy	nation">Egypt</a>  were planning to send planes to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Baghdad</a> .    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt" cat="republic	state	country	dispute	monarchy	nation">Egypt</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria" cat="country	state	republic	dispute">Syria</a>  are on good terms, but they have had their differences.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafez_al-Assad" cat="leaders	person	head	general	president	politician">Hafez Assad</a> 's attempts to  <b>rally</b>  <b>Arab leaders</b> to present a unified front against  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" cat="republic	country	state	words">Israel</a>  gained little ground. He derided  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt" cat="republic	state	country	dispute	monarchy	nation">Egypt</a>  for signing a  <b>peace treaty</b> with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" cat="republic	country	state	words">Israel</a>  in 1979.  <br>
