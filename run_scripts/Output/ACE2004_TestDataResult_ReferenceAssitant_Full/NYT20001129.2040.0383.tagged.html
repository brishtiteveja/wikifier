To that end, they persuaded  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_judge_(England_and_Wales)" cat="">Circuit Judge</a>  N.

And it could take weeks if not months to  <b>count</b> them all, the point that Barry Richard,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" cat="convert	owner	alumnus	aviator	candidate	executive	republican	president	industrialist	person	politician	player	methodists	officer	episcopalian	recipient	nominee	speaker">Bush</a> 's chief  <b>trial lawyer</b> here, said he was trying to make in requesting that the ballots be  <b>transported</b> here.   ``We did it to make a point,'' Richard said in an  <b>interview</b>. ``If you recount any ballots, you have to  <b>recount</b> all of them. Now, we don't think any ballots should be counted, because the manual  <b>recount</b> of ballots is finished. But in the event the  <b>court</b> determines that some ballots should be counted, we wanted them here so they could all be counted.''   Aware that they could not stop the movement of all the ballots,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a> 's  <b>lawyers</b> barely objected to the move, asking only that the disputed ballots that might contain hidden  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a>  votes be separated from the  <b>mass</b>.   ``I know when it's futile,'' said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Boies" cat="person	lawyer	democrat	alumnus	executive">David Boies</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a> 's chief  <b>trial lawyer</b>, to Sauls.   Nonetheless,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a> 's  <b>lawyers</b> were furious at the move, aware that it represents yet another  <b>enormous</b> barrier to their  <b>hopes</b> for an immediate  <b>count</b> of the 14,000 disputed ballots in the two counties and a quick decision from the  <b>judge</b> that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a>  really won the  <b>election</b>. Even if the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Florida" cat="court">Florida Supreme Court</a>  should swiftly agree to their request and orders the counting to begin by  <b>Friday</b>, that would still put them three days behind their original  <b>timetable</b>. And facing a Dec. 12  <b>deadline</b> for the state to name electors for the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)" cat="statistics">Electoral College</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a>  has absolutely no  <b>days</b> to spare.   ``It's a  <b>stunt</b>,'' said Kendall Coffey, one of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a> 's  <b>election</b> lawyers, as he stormed out of Sauls' courtroom  <b>Wednesday</b>, referring to the request for all the ballots. ``They're trying to  <b>bog</b> down the case, the system, the  <b>clerk</b>'s office and everywhere else they can.''   The decision by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a> 's lawyers to  <b>appeal</b> the case shows how  <b>perilous</b> their situation is. By appealing, the lawyers were forced to put on  <b>paper</b> their  <b>fear</b> that their case could be over if they cannot begin counting ballots until Saturday.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice_Advisory_Opinion_on_Western_Sahara" cat="right">The decision</a>  to wait until a Saturday hearing ``is effectively a final  <b>order</b> denying all relief sought by  <b>plaintiffs</b> because the  <b>action</b> now pending below must be completed before Dec. 12, 2000, in order to offer any relief,'' said the notice filed with the Court of  <b>Appeal</b>. It adds, ``the  <b>court</b> must  <b>allow</b> sufficient time to complete an accurate and fair count of the contested ballots, which is essential for the proper  <b>resolution</b> of the contest  <b>action</b>.''   But the decision to bring up all the ballots means that they will not be assembled in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee,_Florida" cat="city	seats	place">Tallahassee</a>  until  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_Night_Videos" cat="ending	show">late Friday</a> , a day later than planned. And even then, the  <b>hurdles</b> are enormous. There will have to be another  <b>hearing</b> before the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Florida" cat="court">Florida Supreme Court</a> , and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a> 's  <b>lawyers</b> will have to  <b>refute</b> three arguments to be raised by the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" cat="convert	owner	alumnus	aviator	candidate	executive	republican	president	industrialist	person	politician	player	methodists	officer	episcopalian	recipient	nominee	speaker">Bush</a>  team: There should be no more counting at all; if there is any counting, it will have to include all 1.16 million ballots; and if there is any counting of disputed ballots,  <b>dimples</b> cannot be counted as votes.   If these issues are heard before Sanders, there will have to be briefs, witnesses, and  <b>evidence</b> on each point, which could take days. If the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Florida" cat="court">Supreme Court</a>  agrees to short-circuit the process, there will still have to be lengthy  <b>briefs</b> filed, and the  <b>court</b> may  <b>need to</b> wait several  <b>days</b> before finding time for yet another momentous hearing in its schedule.  <br>
