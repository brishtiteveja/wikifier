The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Texas" cat="list">Texas governor</a> 's words made equally clear that he saw himself as the country's best hope for bridging  <b>ideological</b> divides,  <b>healing</b>  <b>partisan</b> wounds and making sure that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">Americans</a>  could  <b>gaze</b> upon  <b>the White House</b> with unfettered respect.   ``There's a better day ahead if we have a leader who's willing to unite the country, to bring people together, to elevate the people's  <b>business</b> above everyday  <b>politics</b>,''  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" cat="convert	owner	alumnus	aviator	candidate	executive	republican	president	industrialist	person	politician	player	methodists	officer	episcopalian	recipient	nominee	speaker">Bush</a>  said at a rally inside a  <b>hangar</b> at the  <b>airport</b> here, where supporters' chants evoked the nearness of the moment of decision.   ``One more day!'' they roared. ``One more day!''

Minutes later, he added: ``When you go out there and tell the  <b>folks</b> where we stand on the issues and where we stand when it comes to bringing people together to get things done, and you tell them that the core of this campaign is the inherent  <b>trust</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans" cat="group">the American people</a> , I believe it doesn't matter what political party they're in.
