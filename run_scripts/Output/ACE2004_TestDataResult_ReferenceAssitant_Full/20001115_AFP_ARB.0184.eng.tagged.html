The  <b>radio</b> reported "senior political officials" as saying at the close of the  <b>security</b> cabinet's meeting, chaired by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel" cat="">Prime Minister</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Barak" cat="politician	jew	person	recipient	member	leaders	commander	alumnus	minister	chief">Ehud Barak</a> , that the  <b>army</b> would continue with the  <b>procedure</b> it has followed over the past days and that there would be no  <b>escalation</b>.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces" cat="dispute	recipient	relations	unit">Military officials</a>  who also attended the meeting that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Palestinian_National_Authority" cat="president">Palestinian President</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat" cat="survivor	member	muslim	alumnus	recipient	president	person	engineer	dispute">Yasser Arafat</a>  "wants to drag  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" cat="republic	country	state	words">Israel</a>  into an  <b>escalation</b> which would  <b>lead</b> to international intervention."   The head of the  <b>prime minister</b>'s office, Jalaad Shir, had previously said on official  <b>television</b> that "a  <b>compromise</b> must be found between a studied response not leading to  <b>escalation</b> and the need to pave the way for  <b>political</b> openness, on the condition that the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_people" cat="group	citizen	person">Palestinians</a>  resolutely stop the  <b>violence</b> and  <b>incitement</b> to  <b>violence</b>."   Shir added "only then will it be possible to think about resuming the  <b>political process</b> and on what basis."   The security cabinet was convened to a session with the aim of examining new measures to deal with the  <b>escalation</b> in attacks against  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis" cat="person">Israelis</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories" cat="territory">the West Bank and Gaza Strip</a> .
