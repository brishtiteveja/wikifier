   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Court_in_the_Netherlands" cat="court	organisation	disestablishment	system	establishment	building">Camp Zeist</a>  (Holland) 11-15 (AFP) -  Today  <b>Wednesday</b>, the  <b>judges</b> in charge of looking into the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103_bombing_investigation" cat="">Lockerbie case</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Court_in_the_Netherlands" cat="court	organisation	disestablishment	system	establishment	building">Camp Zeist</a>  (Holland) were faced with an awkward problem: how to deal with a  <b>witness</b> who is refusing to answer questions and who is at the same time serving a  <b>life sentence</b> and who is not subject to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_law" cat="">Scottish law</a> ?   The problem arose after  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_people" cat="group	citizen	person">Palestinian</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Talib_ibn_‘Abd_al-Muttalib" cat="dispute	person">Mahmood Abu Talib</a> , whose  <b>testimony</b> the  <b>court</b> has been  <b>hearing</b> since Friday, refused to continue answering a question by  <b>defense lawyer</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Keen" cat="person	member">Richard Keen</a>  about the detailed reasons for his having lived in the former  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" cat="federation	disestablishment	state	country	republic	polity">Soviet Union</a>  for a period of  <b>18 months</b> in the 70s.   The  <b>lawyer</b> asked the  <b>judges</b> to  <b>force</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Talib_ibn_‘Abd_al-Muttalib" cat="dispute	person">Abu Talib</a>  to answer the question aimed at demonstrating the  <b>witness</b>'s "professional terrorism" precedents.   46-year-old  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Talib_ibn_‘Abd_al-Muttalib" cat="dispute	person">Abu Talib</a>  was sentenced to  <b>life imprisonment</b> in  <b>1990</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden" cat="country	state">Sweden</a>  for  <b>terrorist acts</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam" cat="place	city	venue	capital">Amsterdam</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen" cat="seats	city	capital	place">Copenhagen</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm" cat="school	institution">Stockholm</a>  between  <b>1985</b> and  <b>1986</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Hornburg" cat="battle">The defense</a>  council in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockerbie" cat="">Lockerbie</a>   <b>court</b> is attempting to show his involvement in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockerbie" cat="">Lockerbie</a>  attack.   Based on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_law" cat="">Scottish law</a> , followed in this  <b>court</b>, if  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Talib_ibn_‘Abd_al-Muttalib" cat="dispute	person">Abu Talib</a>  insists on not responding to the question, this is considered to be "contempt of court" and means he may be punished in  <b>accordance</b> with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_law" cat="">Scottish law</a>  covering such incidents.   The problem is that the judges may not punish  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Talib_ibn_‘Abd_al-Muttalib" cat="dispute	person">Abu Talib</a>  unless  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden" cat="country	state">Sweden</a>  hands him over to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" cat="country	nation">Scotland</a>  after the  <b>court</b> case ends to apply the  <b>punishment</b> for "contempt of  <b>court</b>."   So far, the  <b>judges</b> have not asked  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Talib_ibn_‘Abd_al-Muttalib" cat="dispute	person">Abu Talib</a>  to answer the defense's question in what appears to be a move to avoid a tricky situation if the  <b>witness</b> refuses to answer.   The  <b>court</b> president, Ronald Sutherland, who adjourned the session for a short while in an attempt to find a  <b>solution</b> to this  <b>dilemma</b>, said "this raises an important question of principle."   The two Libyans, Alameen Khalifa Fahima and Abdulbasit al-Maqrahi, are suspected of sending a  <b>bomb</b> from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta" cat="country	state	colony	republic	member	recipient	island">Malta</a>  which was used to explode the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_American_World_Airways" cat="member	airline">Pan Am</a>  plane over the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" cat="country	nation">Scottish</a>   <b>village</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockerbie" cat="">Lockerbie</a>  on December 21, 1988 killing 270 people. <br>
