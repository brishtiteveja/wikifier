 Documented.

A  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" cat="colony	state">Florida</a>  State  <b>judge</b> has ordered  <b>local election</b> officials to  <b>ship</b>  <b>thousands</b> of ballots to the  <b>state capital</b>. The move comes as the  <b>judge</b> decides whether to order a  <b>recount</b> of those ballots in the  <b>presidential</b> election.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR" cat="channels	broadcaster	establishment	company">NPR</a> 's Steve Inski was in the  <b>courtroom</b>. Steve, what are the issues that came up in this  <b>hearing</b> tonight?    <b>Corey</b>  <b>judge</b> N. Sander Sauls is deciding whether to order a  <b>recount</b> as you said of those ballots, 9000 or more actually from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Dade_County,_Florida" cat="county">Miami Dade County</a>  that apparently were never counted at all, at least according to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Democrats</a>  in the  <b>presidential election</b> and about 3300 ballots from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida" cat="establishment	county">Palm Beach County</a>  that were considered by local officials but then thrown out, disallowed.  <b>Judge</b> Sauls is deciding whether to count those ballots and go through them and perhaps add some votes to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Al Gore</a> 's final total, which is exactly what the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Democrats</a>  want. He is not ready to do that yet. He did not agree to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Democratic</a>  proposal to begin counting  <b>tomorrow morning</b> but he has ordered that the ballots be shipped up. Later this week,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Police_Department" cat="agency	department">Miami Police</a>  apparently are going to escort them upto  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee,_Florida" cat="city	seats	place">Tallahassee</a>  and they will be ready to be counted if the  <b>judge</b> decides at a later time to do so.   Now time is a big  <b>consideration</b> from here. What's the  <b>judge</b>'s  <b>timetable</b>?   Not as fast as the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Democrats</a>  would like, not as slowly as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Republicans</a>  would prefer. He is going to order a major  <b>hearing</b> on Saturday to review all the  <b>legal</b> and  <b>evidentiary</b> issues, look at  <b>evidence</b>, perhaps hear from witnesses and after that the  <b>judge</b> will  <b>decide</b> if there are any ballots to count. It might take another five  <b>days</b> or so to do it. Neither side seemed  <b>particularly</b> pleased by the  <b>timetable</b> but the  <b>judge</b> said, well, I am going to make everybody equally unhappy.   Thank you.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR" cat="channels	broadcaster	establishment	company">NPR</a> 's Steven Inksi reporting from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee,_Florida" cat="city	seats	place">Tallahassee, Florida</a> . As the  <b>battle</b> over votes goes on in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" cat="colony	state">Florida</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington" cat="">Washington</a>  State is in the middle of recounting the votes cast in its very tight  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate" cat="house">US Senate</a>   <b>race</b>. Jennifer Nesan reports from member  <b>station</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPLU-FM" cat="stations">KPLU</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle" cat="seats	place	city	settlement">Seattle</a> .    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_election_recount" cat="">The recount</a>  of the votes cast for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Democrat</a>  Maria Catwell and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Republican</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate" cat="house">Senator</a>  Slate Gordon is calm and organized. The State's  <b>Elections</b> Director Garry Macintosh says the process is about as exciting as watching  <b>paint</b> dry.   There are a lot of things about the  <b>election</b>'s process I think that are fairly  <b>complex</b>. This isn't probably one of them.   Catwell leads  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Republican</a>   <b>incumbent</b> Slate Gordon by fewer then 2000 votes. At this point neither of the candidates plan to contest any of the votes.  <b>State law</b> requires a  <b>recount</b> when the  <b>margin</b> of victory is less than one half of 1 percent.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_election_recount" cat="">The recount</a>  is expected to be completed by the end of the week. No  <b>statewide recount</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington" cat="">Washington</a>  has ever changed the initial outcome.
