The official who  <b>wished</b> to remain anonymous confirmed "we have paid a great deal of attention to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin" cat="">President Putin</a> 's announcement but it does not contain many new elements, in fact just a few new disparities which require further  <b>examination</b> and discussion by experts."    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton" cat="humanitarian	recipient	saxophonist	spouse	nominee	candidate	memoirists	lawyer	winner	person	democrat	scholar	official	baptists	president	adoptee	activist	alumnus	companion	figure	politician	vegan">Clinton</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin" cat="">Putin</a>  are taking part in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation" cat="organization	establishment">Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation</a>  ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation" cat="organization	establishment">APEC</a> ) forum in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar_Seri_Begawan" cat="place	capital">Bandar Seri Begawan</a>  the  <b>capital</b> of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunei" cat="state	member	country">Sultanate of Brunei</a> .  The presidents met for a  <b>working lunch</b> of around  <b>75 minutes</b>.   The American official stressed that what is important in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin" cat="">Putin</a> 's proposal is that it falls within the "framework adopted by the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">United States</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" cat="country	nation	republic	state">Russia</a>  to discuss strategic issues from a defensive and  <b>offensive</b> point of view."    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin" cat="">Putin</a>  proposed limiting the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language" cat="language">Russian</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">American</a>   <b>nuclear capabilities</b> by reducing the number of nuclear heads to under  <b>1500</b> each, a smaller number than that in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_American" cat="relations	group	person">Russian-American</a>  Start-3  <b>treaty</b> currently being negotiated.  He proposed that the current reduction should be between 2500 to  <b>2000</b> nuclear heads.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin" cat="">Putin</a>  said this reduction would depend on compliance with the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_American" cat="relations	group	person">Russian-American</a>  anti-ABM  <b>missile</b>  <b>treaty</b> signed in  <b>1972</b>, which the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">Americans</a>  are attempting to  <b>amend</b> to set up anti- missile defenses ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_defense_systems_of_various_nations" cat="">NMD</a> ).   Washington has so far confirmed agreeing to the  <b>2000</b> to 2500  <b>nuclear warhead</b>  <b>ceiling</b>.   <b>The United States</b> has not taken a final position on the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_defense_systems_of_various_nations" cat="">NMD</a>  system because  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton" cat="humanitarian	recipient	saxophonist	spouse	nominee	candidate	memoirists	lawyer	winner	person	democrat	scholar	official	baptists	president	adoptee	activist	alumnus	companion	figure	politician	vegan">Clinton</a> , whose term ends in January, is leaving the decision in this  <b>matter</b> to his successor.
