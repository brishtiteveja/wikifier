Two men have been killed, and a third has been injured since the  <b>hunting season</b> opened on Nov. 15. All three  <b>accidents</b> involved  <b>shotguns</b>, elevated  <b>platforms</b> and a practice relatively new to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan" cat="state">Michigan</a>   <b>hunters</b> _ shooting at  <b>deer</b> from  <b>trees</b>. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan" cat="state">Michigan</a>  season, one of the busiest, continues through  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_30" cat="days">Nov. 30</a> .    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm" cat="firearm">Firearm</a>  hunting from elevated  <b>platforms</b> has long been legal in other  <b>states</b> with heavy  <b>hunting</b>, like  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania" cat="colony	state">Pennsylvania</a> . But the practice is only in its third season in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan" cat="state">Michigan</a> , and officials say it appears that  <b>hunters</b> still have a lot to learn about safety. Lt. Suzanne Koppelo,  <b>hunter safety</b>  <b>administrator</b> of the  <b>law enforcement</b> division of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Department_of_Natural_Resources" cat="agency">Michigan Department of Natural Resources</a>  &UR; , &LR; said that since  <b>firearm</b> platform  <b>hunting</b> began in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan" cat="state">Michigan</a>  there had been seven shooting  <b>accidents</b> linked to the practice. Three were fatal. Two  <b>hunters</b> shot themselves on  <b>platforms</b> and another was killed on the ground by a  <b>hunter</b> shooting from a  <b>platform</b>. ``If  <b>hunters</b> exercised the kind of caution one would expect at heights of 20-some  <b>feet</b>, it would be almost a nonissue,'' said Koppelo. ``But given  <b>human nature</b>, that's not the case.''   More than 750,000 licensed hunters are taking to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan" cat="state">Michigan</a>  woods this year, where they are expected to kill about 500,000 of the  <b>state</b>'s 1.9 million  <b>deer</b>. The numbers reinforce the need to improve  <b>education</b> about platform  <b>hunting</b> with  <b>firearms</b>, Koppelo said.   The practice is more commonly associated with  <b>hunters</b> using  <b>bows and arrows</b>. Instead of hiding on the ground or walking through the woods, they wait quietly, typically at a height of 15 to 20  <b>feet</b>, and fire down at  <b>deer</b> that wander below.   Despite the  <b>hunter</b> killed from the platform, Sgt. Larry D. Sargent,  <b>hunter</b>  <b>education</b>  <b>field</b> coordinator for the  <b>law enforcement</b>  <b>division</b>, says the practice does offer one safety advantage: errant shots typically thump harmlessly to the ground, rather than whistling through the woods and striking other people.   The problems primarily arise when  <b>hunters</b> get in and out of position.   ``It's kind of hard  <b>climbing</b> a  <b>tree</b> with a  <b>gun</b>,''  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Williams" cat="person	writer">Rob Williams</a>  said, as he and a  <b>hunting</b> partner, Art Bush, waited on a recent morning in a conventional  <b>earthbound</b>  <b>hunting</b> blind about 20 miles west of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit" cat="demographic">Detroit</a> .   For  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Williams" cat="person	writer">Williams</a> , Rule No. 1 is not to climb a  <b>tree</b> with a  <b>loaded gun</b>. He says that when he hunts from a platform he climbs up with a  <b>rope</b> dangling from his  <b>belt</b> to his  <b>gun</b>, which he leaves unloaded on the ground. When he is secure in his stand, he pulls his  <b>gun</b> up after him and loads it. Sargent says this is proper  <b>procedure</b>.   One  <b>accident</b> this year, however, illustrates the importance of following each step of the safety procedures. A 16-year-old  <b>hunter</b> used a haul line, but it was tied to the  <b>trigger guard</b> and he left the  <b>gun</b> loaded, Koppelo said. The  <b>teen-ager</b>'s  <b>gun</b> went off and he was shot in the foot.   Others are hurt falling out of  <b>trees</b>. Koppelo said that state officials were trying to keep  <b>count</b> of these injuries but that it was difficult, since they relied on  <b>hunters</b> reporting minor accidents.   ``A lot of guys are embarrassed,'' Sargent said. ``They'll say they fell working in the  <b>yard</b> or something.''   Others, Koppelo says, do not  <b>want to</b> report  <b>accidents</b> for  <b>fear</b> the  <b>law</b> will be changed. And she adds that though  <b>anecdotal reports</b> show  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan" cat="state">Michigan</a> 's large  <b>hunting</b>  <b>population</b> to be taking slowly to  <b>firearm</b>  <b>deer hunting</b> from platforms, most expect the practice to catch on as it has in other states.   As Peter Thompson, a 16-year-old hunter, said, ``Usually the deer don't look up.''  <br>
