 ECONOMISTS &LR; &QL; &UR; By  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Landler" cat="person	writer	journalist">MARK LANDLER</a>  &LR; &QC; &QL; &UR; c.2000  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_The_New_York_Times_Company" cat="list">N.Y. Times News Service</a>  &LR; &QC; &QL;     <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" cat="city	country	area	establishment	place	colony	region">HONG KONG</a>  _ For most of this year,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" cat="">Asia</a> 's economies have performed a sort of levitating act _ growing by double-digit rates month after month even as economists predicted they would fall to  <b>earth</b>.   That  <b>dichotomy</b> was on vivid display here Friday:  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" cat="city	country	area	establishment	place	colony	region">Hong Kong</a>  reported that its  <b>economic output</b> surged  <b>10.4</b> percent in the third quarter, and it raised its projection for full-year growth to 10 percent from 8.5 percent.   Yet a block away, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" cat="establishment	institution	economics	nation">International Monetary Fund</a>  warned in a  <b>news conference</b> that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Asia" cat="economy">Asian economies</a>  could be  <b>hit</b> hard by  <b>soaring</b>  <b>oil prices</b> and turmoil in the  <b>financial markets</b>.  <b>The IMF</b> said a $5 increase in the  <b>price</b> of a  <b>barrel</b> of  <b>oil</b> could slow the  <b>growth rates</b> of  <b>Asian countries</b> next year.   ``The prospects for growth in  <b>2001</b> have weakened,'' said David Robinson,  <b>assistant director</b> of  <b>research</b> at the fund. ``There has also been increased  <b>political</b> instability across the world, not least in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" cat="">Asia</a> .''   Several Asian countries _ notably the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines" cat="republic	state	philippines	country	island	colony">Philippines</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan" cat="dispute	island">Taiwan</a> , and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia" cat="state	nation	republic	country">Indonesia</a>  _ have been gripped by  <b>political</b> tumult in recent weeks.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines" cat="republic	state	philippines	country	island	colony">The Philippines</a>   <b>president</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Estrada" cat="person	recipient	catholic	actor	politician	official	president	criminal">Joseph Estrada</a> , was  <b>impeached</b> last week, while  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Shui-bian" cat="politician	prisoner	person	survivor	member	alumnus	mayor	nominee	president">Chen Shui-bian</a> , the  <b>president</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan" cat="dispute	island">Taiwan</a> , is trying to  <b>fend</b> off a  <b>recall</b> vote.   Even in more stable countries, like  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia" cat="country	state	nation	colony	member">Malaysia</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" cat="country	republic	state	region	nation">South Korea</a> , Robinson said the Fund was concerned by the  <b>haphazard</b> pace of  <b>economic</b> reforms. In many countries, the banks and  <b>corporations</b> remain financially  <b>shaky</b>.   ``We're still seeing  <b>chaebols</b> in deep trouble,'' he said, referring to Korea's heavily indebted  <b>conglomerates</b>.   But Robinson acknowledged that these  <b>weaknesses</b> had not yet been reflected in the  <b>economic performance</b> of the countries. On Tuesday,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" cat="country	republic	state	region	nation">South Korea</a>  reported a 9.2 percent increase in its third-quarter  <b>output</b> _ beating the estimates of most analysts and extending a string of powerful quarters.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia" cat="state	nation	republic	country">Indonesia</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia" cat="country	state	nation	colony	member">Malaysia</a> , and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore" cat="country	republic	colony	member	capital	place	state">Singapore</a>  have also beaten expectations, while  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" cat="city	country	area	establishment	place	colony	region">Hong Kong</a> 's  <b>growth rate</b> was  <b>nearly</b> three  <b>percentage points</b> above a  <b>median</b> forecast of 12 economists surveyed by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Television" cat="channels	stations">Bloomberg News</a> .   Like other  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Asia" cat="economy">Asian economies</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" cat="city	country	area	establishment	place	colony	region">Hong Kong</a>  has been buoyed by an unquenchable  <b>appetite</b> for its  <b>exports</b>, principally in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">United States</a> .  <b>Exports</b> surged 17.7 percent in the third quarter.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" cat="city	country	area	establishment	place	colony	region">Hong Kong</a>  has done a  <b>particularly</b> booming  <b>business</b> in repackaging and  <b>shipping</b>  <b>goods</b> from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China" cat="dispute">mainland China</a> .    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending" cat="socioeconomics	macroeconomics">Consumer spending</a>  rose by a much less impressive 5.6 percent, as  <b>retail sales</b> slackened from the second quarter. And  <b>consumer prices</b> fell 2 percent, extending a decline that began during the crisis.   Ian Perkin,  <b>chief economist</b> at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_General_Chamber_of_Commerce" cat="">Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce</a>  said the double-digit growth in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" cat="city	country	area	establishment	place	colony	region">Hong Kong</a>  and other  <b>Asian countries</b> masked their underlying condition. While the  <b>region</b>'s growth in  <b>exports</b> has been torrid, domestic demand has remained tenuous.   ``We haven't built up our domestic economies yet,'' he said. ``The recovery has relied almost completely on  <b>export</b> growth.   ``If  <b>consumer spending</b> slows down in  <b>the States</b>, it will have a devastating effect on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" cat="">Asia</a> ,'' said Perkin. ``2001 could be a crunch year.''   Robinson of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" cat="establishment	institution	economics	nation">IMF</a>  was similarly  <b>wary</b> about next year. In October, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" cat="establishment	institution	economics	nation">IMF</a>  projected that the  <b>world economy</b> would grow 4.2 percent in  <b>2001</b>, while  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" cat="">Asia</a>  as a  <b>region</b> would grow 6.6 percent. On Friday, Robinson said the  <b>growth rate</b> could be lower, though he would not say by how much.   A principal  <b>culprit</b> of possibly slower growth is the dependence of many Asian countries on imported  <b>oil</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_petroleum" cat="warrant	economics">Oil prices</a>  have risen $5 per  <b>barrel</b> since the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" cat="establishment	institution	economics	nation">IMF</a>  issued its semi-annual  <b>economic outlook</b> in October.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" cat="">Asia</a>  has little control over  <b>oil</b>, but Robinson said the  <b>region</b> could improve its  <b>economic</b> prospects by calming its  <b>political</b> waters.   One  <b>bright spot</b> in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_American" cat="dispute	person	issue">Asian</a>  landscape is  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" cat="peoples	civilization	region">China</a> , which is on track to record 8 percent growth in  <b>2000</b>. Robinson said the main question facing  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_leaders" cat="president	politics">Chinese leaders</a>  was whether they  <b>need to</b> spend billions of  <b>dollars</b> in  <b>public funds</b> to further stimulate an economy that was already expanding.   Like Perkin, Robinson said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" cat="">Asia</a> 's future depended in large part on the  <b>health</b> of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">United States</a> . But he disputed those who predict dramatically  <b>slowing</b> growth _ the so-called hard landing _ for the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States" cat="economy">American economy</a> .   ``The chances of that happening are less than 40 percent,'' he said, ``substantially less.''  <br>
