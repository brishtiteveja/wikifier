Inoue quoted  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoko_Asahara" cat="person	leaders	prisoner	buddhist	member">Asahara</a>  as saying that he needed to meditate about it. <br><br> Last April, the  <b>defense</b> raised similar objections, but the prosecutors refused to change their statement.
