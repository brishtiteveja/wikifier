I agree with him whole-heartedly and would like to know where to  <b>mail</b> my  <b>checks</b> to subscribe to the  <b>company</b>'s  <b>shares</b>. Could you advise? <br><br> Also, I fully support his request for the media to report on the   <b>lifestyle</b>   of former   <b>executives</b>   of the failed  banks   and  finance   companies. We all know too well that these people will not be punished legally because of the  <b>inefficiency</b> of the   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Thailand" cat="banks">Bank of Thailand</a>    in collecting  <b>evidence</b> against them and of our   <b>justice system</b>   in delivering  <b>timely</b>  <b>justice</b>. It is the  <b>media</b>'s job to discover how these guys are better off after destroying our country, and it is the   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_people" cat="group	peoples">Thai people</a>   's job to socially punish them. <br><br> I would like to propose that   <b>newspapers</b>   and   <b>TV stations</b>  play up this issue (the continued luxurious  <b>lifestyle</b> of the former executives) to attract more public attention, and I will give them Bt20,000 of my hard-earned  <b>salary</b> with my full blessing. <br><br> Artit Krichphiphat (An ordinary Thai  <b>citizen</b> who wants to see the right things get done)  <b>Editor</b>'s note: Khun Mechai will organise a  <b>seminar</b> on the plan on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_7" cat="days">June 7</a>  at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone" cat="group">Telephone</a>  Organisation of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand" cat="country">Thailand</a>  at 10 am.
