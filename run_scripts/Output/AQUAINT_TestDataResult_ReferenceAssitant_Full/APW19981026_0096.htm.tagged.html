   Report:   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" cat="nation	member	country	state">South Africa</a>   n truth panel to condemn  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" cat="organisation	party	movement">ANC</a> <br><br> A panel probing   <b>apartheid</b>  -era abuses has accused the   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" cat="organisation	party	movement">African National Congress</a>    of   <b>human rights</b>   violations, including   <b>torture</b>   and  bomb   attacks, the state  broadcaster   said Monday. <br><br> The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" cat="organisation	party	movement">ANC</a> , which led the struggle against   <b>white</b> rule   and now is in  <b>power</b>, previously has acknowledged it was  <b>told</b> to expect  <b>implication</b> in right violations. <br><br>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_(South_Africa)" cat="event	organisation">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a>    will release its  <b>final report</b> on 2 1-2 years of investigation on  <b>Thursday</b>. The report was expected to place overwhelming blame for the era's abuses on white governments and their brutal  <b>security services</b>. <br><br>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Broadcasting_Corporation" cat="channels">South African Broadcasting Corp.</a>    radio said it had been  <b>leaked</b> a "preliminary document'' which condemns the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" cat="organisation	party	movement">ANC</a>  as politically and  <b>morally</b> responsible for  <b>gross</b>  <b>human rights violations</b> during and after the fall of  <b>apartheid</b>. <br><br> An  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" cat="organisation	party	movement">ANC</a>  spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said he believed the  <b>news</b> report referred to a commission letter sent in advance "informing us of its intention to implicate the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" cat="organisation	party	movement">ANC</a>  in  <b>gross</b>  <b>human rights violations</b>.'' <br><br> Commission officials could not  <b>immediately</b> be  <b>reached</b> for comment. <br><br> The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" cat="organisation	party	movement">ANC</a>  was nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with  commissioners   earlier this month. The panel refused, to avoid appearing embarrassed. <br><br> The party says the accusations against it likely would  <b>center</b> on the planting of   <b>land mines</b>   on  <b>border</b>  <b>farms</b>, abuses at its  <b>military</b> camps in  Angola  and bombings. <br><br> (djw) <br><br>
