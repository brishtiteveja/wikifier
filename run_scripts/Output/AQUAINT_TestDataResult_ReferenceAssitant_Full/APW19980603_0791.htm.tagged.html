 <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand" cat="country">THAILAND</a> <br><br> MORE and more people are dying or suffering from fatal  <b>diseases</b> such as   <b>brain tumours</b>  , mammarian or   <b>breast cancer</b>   and brain   <b>haemorrhage</b>   due to a lack of proper  <b>medical</b> care.However, things may change as the Srisiam  <b>Hospital</b> in   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok" cat="">Bangkok</a>    has now established the first ever   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosurgery" cat="treatment	robot">Radio Surgery</a>    Institute in   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand" cat="country">Thailand</a>    -- (there are presently more than 100  <b>radio surgery</b> centres around the world). <br><br>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosurgery" cat="treatment	robot">Radio surgery</a>  is a modern technique which doesn't require  <b>surgery</b> in order to remove   <b>cancerous</b>   growth or   <b>tissues</b>  . It involves a   <b>three dimensional</b>   method known as  Stereotaxic  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery" cat="obstetrics">Surgery</a>   , which is also used in conjunction with   <b>radiation</b>   equipment known as the   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_particle_accelerator" cat="">Linear Accelerator</a>   . <br><br> With this new technology,  <b>doctors</b> are able to removal  <b>cancerous</b>  <b>tissues</b> embedded deep inside the  <b>brain</b> or near sensitive  <b>organs</b> that makes normal surgery very difficult and risky. With  <b>radio surgery</b>, every step is controlled by  <b>computers</b> and patients are   <b>conscious</b>   while they undergo treatment. <br><br> This new technique is also capable of treating  <b>diseases</b> such as Artero Venous   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder" cat="disorder">Malformation</a>    (the  clotting   of  <b>veins</b> or blood   <b>capillaries</b>  in the brain).So far, ninety per  <b>cent</b> of the  <b>radio surgery</b> treatments have been successful and patients only have to remain in  <b>hospital</b> for three days. Additionally, there is no need for patients to  <b>shave</b> their heads and  <b>radio surgery</b> causes no  <b>scar</b>, little  <b>blood loss</b> and is not expensive.For more information contact the hospital at srisiam ksc.th.com. <br><br>
