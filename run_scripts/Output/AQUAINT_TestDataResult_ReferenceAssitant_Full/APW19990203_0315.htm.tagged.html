The objects will be  <b>flown</b> to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" cat="country	nation	member	state	monarchy">Italy</a>  this week, along with pieces that were loaned to the  <b>museum</b> for an   <b>antiquities</b>   exhibit, according to a statement issued by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Paul_Getty_Museum" cat="museum	mountain">the Getty</a>  on Monday. <br><br> <br><br> The stolen items are a  <b>terra cotta</b> drinking cup from 480   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini" cat="controversy	terms	phrase">B.C.</a>   , found to have been illegally   <b>excavated</b>   from an  archaeological site  ; a   <b>torso</b>   of the god   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithraic_mysteries" cat="religion	mystery">Mithras</a>    from the   <b>2nd century</b>  , found to have been stolen from a  <b>private</b> Italian collection; and the sculpted head of a victorious  <b>athlete</b>, a 2nd century  Roman   copy of an earlier  Greek   work, which was apparently taken from the storeroom of a scientific  <b>excavation</b>. <br><br> <br><br> For  <b>security</b> reasons, the  <b>museum</b> did not say how much the pieces are worth. <br><br> <br><br> Although nobody claimed the works,  <b>Getty</b> decided to return them based on information supplied by experts in the  <b>field</b> and in consultation with Italian officials. <br><br> <br><br> International concern has been growing about rampant  thefts   of priceless  <b>art</b> from collections and the   <b>looting</b>   of  <b>archaeological sites</b>. <br><br> <br><br> The billion-dollar  <b>museum</b>, located on a  <b>hill</b> in the  Brentwood  area, opened in 1997. <br><br>
