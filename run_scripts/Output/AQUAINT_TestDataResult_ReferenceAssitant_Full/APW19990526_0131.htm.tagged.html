The  <b>area</b> is about 60 miles southwest of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorage,_Alaska" cat="place	city	settlement">Anchorage</a> . <br><br> <br><br> The fatal mauling is thought to have happened Tuesday. <br><br> <br><br> His only visible  <b>wound</b> was  <b>a single bite</b> to the head, said Bruce Bartley, a spokesman for the state Division of  <b>Wildlife Conservation</b>. <br><br> <br><br> State and federal  <b>wildlife</b> officials were  <b>looking</b> for the  <b>bear</b> involved in the attack. If the  <b>bear</b> is judged to pose a continuing threat to  <b>humans</b> it may be killed. <br><br> <br><br>  <b>Troopers</b> said Cates' .280-caliber   <b>rifle</b>   and two spent  <b>shell casings</b> were found near the body, along with traces of  <b>blood</b> that suggest that Cates may have wounded the  <b>animal</b>. <br><br> <br><br> "We don't know if one was a warning shot and one real, or if there were two real shots,'' Bartley said. <br><br> <br><br> Cates' death is the first fatal bear mauling in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" cat="state">Alaska</a>  since Feb. 8, 1998, when  Audelio Luis Cortes  , 40, was killed while working on a   <b>seismic</b>   crew in the   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swanson_River" cat="river">Swanson River</a>      <b>oil field</b>   near   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenai,_Alaska" cat="place	city">Kenai</a>  . Cortes also died from a single head bite. <br><br>
