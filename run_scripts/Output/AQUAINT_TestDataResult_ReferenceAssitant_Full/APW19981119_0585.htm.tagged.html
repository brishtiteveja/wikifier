   This "Dracula'' kills   <b>cattle</b>   and deer<br><br> A giant black   <b>bear</b>  , whom   <b>peasants</b>   have nicknamed "Dracula,'' is creating  <b>anxiety</b> in western   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania" cat="member	state	monarchy	country	republic">Romania</a>    because of his  <b>taste</b> for  <b>cattle</b> and   <b>sheep</b>  , an official said  <b>Thursday</b>. <br><br>  <b>Peasants</b> whose   <b>livestock</b>   has been devoured by the hungry  <b>bear</b> have  <b>lodged</b> seven complaints in the past six weeks, said Nicolae Onetiu, head of the state hunting and fishing  reserves   in western  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania" cat="member	state	monarchy	country	republic">Romania</a> . <br><br>  Dracula   was named after the   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transylvania" cat="country	region	dispute">Transylvania</a>   n   <b>vampire</b>   count of  <b>legend</b> because of his bloody  <b>appetite</b>, said Onetiu. The  <b>male</b>  <b>bruin</b> weighs at least 300   <b>kilograms</b>   (660 pounds) and has moved closer to inhabited areas from forested  <b>regions</b> with the onset of cold  <b>weather</b>, but is apparently not yet ready to   <b>hibernate</b>  . <br><br> Dracula has killed at least six  <b>cows</b> and seven  <b>sheep</b> over the past six weeks. <br><br> Most bears are   <b>omnivorous</b>  , but in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania" cat="member	state	monarchy	country	republic">Romania</a> , many bears were   <b>weaned</b>   on meat, said Onetiu.   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae_CeauÈ™escu" cat="secretary	atheist	recipient	person	leaders	member	execution	president	ruler	inmate">Nicolae Ceausescu</a>   , the   <b>communist</b>    dictator   toppled and  <b>executed</b> almost a  <b>decade</b> ago, was an avid  <b>hunter</b>, and  <b>hunting reserve</b>  <b>cubs</b> were fed meat to make them grow bigger quicker, leaving generations partial to meat. <br><br> State   <b>rangers</b>   count  <b>135</b> bears living in the   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apuseni_Mountains" cat="">Apuseni Mountains</a>   in western  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania" cat="member	state	monarchy	country	republic">Romania</a> , all of them protected by law. <br><br> (str/am/gj ) <br><br>
